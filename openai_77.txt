The Need for Closure and Susceptibility to Misinformation
Introduction to Need for Closure and Misinformation
The need for closure (NFC) is a psychological trait defined as “the expedient desire for any firm belief on a given topic, as opposed to confusion and uncertainty” ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=Need for closure may also,348%2C italics in)). Individuals high in NFC have a strong preference for clarity and quick resolution of ambiguity. Kruglanski’s lay epistemic theory describes how high NFC leads people to “seize” on information that provides an immediate answer and then “freeze” their judgment to preserve closure ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=defined as a desire to,2018)). In the context of misinformation, this motivation for certainty can make people more prone to quickly accepting an initial claim – even if it’s false – because it offers a satisfying explanation and resolves ambiguity ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=Consequently%2C individuals with a high,Need for)). Likewise, once they have accepted a claim, high-NFC individuals may resist revisiting or correcting that belief, since corrections introduce uncertainty and unsettle their established understanding ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=Consequently%2C

Foundational work by Kruglanski and colleagues linked NFC to a tendency to prefer order, predictability, and decisiveness, as well as an aversion to ambiguity ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=Initially grounded in the theory,Kossowska and Bukowski%2C 2015)). NFC is related to (but distinct from) traits like intolerance of ambiguity and dogmatism, and has been associated with stronger ideological conservatism and prejudice ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=motives associated with endorsing conspiracy,Roets and Van Hiel%2C 2011)). Importantly, political psychologists have noted that certain personality characteristics common among conservatives – e.g. high need for closure and avoidance of complexity – might make them more susceptible to clinging to misinformation or experiencing “backfire” effects when confronted with corrections (). However, NFC is a general cognitive-motivational trait that can influence information processing across the political spectrum.

In recent years, researchers have explored how NFC affects misinformation belief – that is, the likelihood of endorsing false claims in domains ranging from politics to health. Below, we review theoretical explanations and empirical findings on NFC’s role in misinformation susceptibility. We examine evidence from political misinformation and conspiracy theories, health-related misinformation (e.g. vaccine myths), and general false information phenomena. We also highlight moderating factors – such as cognitive style, media exposure, and ideology – that shape this relationship. A summary table of key studies and findings is included at the end for quick reference.

Theoretical Perspectives: Why Need for Closure Matters
Several theoretical frameworks suggest that high NFC should increase susceptibility to misinformation. Because high-NFC individuals urgently seek definite answers, they may latch onto a plausible claim before fully vetting it. Misinformation often provides a simplified explanation for complex events – exactly the kind of certainty high-NFC people find attractive ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=defined as a desire to,2018)) ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=Consequently%2C individuals with a high,Need for)). For example, conspiracy theories offer clear, though false, narratives that identify hidden causes for confusing events. Such accounts can be “particularly attractive for individuals high in NFC because they reduce ambiguity by providing simple and structured explanations” ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=Webster ,2018)). Empirically, this “addiction to answers” is supported by research: people high in NFC tend to seize on conspiratorial explanations for uncertain events, especially when no official account is available ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=dos Reis et al,role of NCC in conspiracy)).

High NFC not only affects initial belief formation (“seizing”) but also later information processing (“freezing”). Once a high-NFC person has committed to a belief (be it true or false), they are motivated to preserve closure. This can mean discounting new information that contradicts their belief or resisting corrections of misinformation. As one review noted, high-NFC individuals may be “more trusting of initial misinformation, which provides closure by explaining events, and more resistant to corrections, which may sow confusion” ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=Consequently%2C individuals with a high,Need for)). In other words, the very trait that leads them to grab onto an answer also makes them less receptive to updates or nuance ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=Schnabel Moulding et al,Reference Marchlewska%2C Cichocka and Kossowska)). This aligns with findings that NFC correlates with selective exposure – a preference for information that confirms one’s existing views ([Reconsidering the effects of trait need for closure on information ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656612000815#:~:text=,trait need for)). By avoiding dissenting or corrective information, high-NFC individuals can maintain a sense of certainty, albeit at the cost of potentially clinging to false beliefs.

It is important to note that evidence on NFC and misinformation is not entirely one-sided. Some studies have failed to find a significant link between NFC and belief in specific falsehoods ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=endorsement of conspiracy theories are,nonsignificant after adjusting for demographic)), and a few even suggest high NFC might protect against certain misinformation under particular conditions ([How Psychological Factors Play Into Vaccine Misinformation – Texas A&M Stories](https://today.tamu.edu/2020/03/26/how-psychological-factors-play-into-vaccine-misinformation/#:~:text=The analysis found that people,to target their psychological disposition)). The effect of NFC can depend on context – for instance, whether a credible official explanation is available, or whether the individual’s ideological commitments align with the misinformation. Below we delve into empirical findings across domains, noting such nuances and moderators.

Political Misinformation and Conspiracy Theories
Political misinformation (e.g. fake news about candidates or policies) and conspiracy theories have been fertile ground for studying NFC. These domains often involve complex, ambiguous events (elections, pandemics, social crises) that spawn competing narratives. High-NFC individuals, eager for clarity, may gravitate to whatever narrative gives them closure – sometimes the misinformed one.

Conspiracy Beliefs: Research consistently frames conspiracy theories as epistemically appealing to those uncomfortable with uncertainty ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=Webster ,2018)). Conspiracies provide a tidy explanation (often blaming a hidden group) for bewildering events. High NFC has been theorized to foster conspiracy beliefs “about events that lack clear official explanations” () (). Marta Marchlewska and colleagues tested this idea in experiments: When an event had no official account (e.g. a mysterious plane crash or a refugee crisis), higher NFC predicted greater endorsement of conspiracy explanations – especially when those conspiracy ideas were made salient () (). However, when an event did have an official, non-conspiratorial explanation, high-NFC individuals were less inclined to believe a conspiracy theory, presumably because the official story itself satisfied their need for closure (). In Marchlewska et al.’s words, “people high (vs. low) in NFC seize on conspiratorial explanations for uncertain events when such explanations are situationally accessible,” but will accept an official explanation if it convincingly fills the knowledge gap (). This finding illustrates a moderating role of information availability: high-NFC individuals aren’t inherently pro-conspiracy, but they will grab whichever explanation (official or not) is handy and satisfying ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=In line with the findings,scholars also proposed that NCC)) ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=The objective of the present,People with lower)).

Broadly, evidence linking dispositional NFC to conspiracy belief has been mixed in magnitude. Early studies found null correlations (e.g. no significant association in samples studied by Imhoff & Bruder 2014, or Leman & Cinnirella 2013) ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=endorsement of conspiracy theories are,nonsignificant after adjusting for demographic)). Others have found small but significant effects: some positive (higher NFC → slightly higher conspiracy endorsement) ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=associations ,an official account of the)) and even one negative (higher NFC → slightly lower conspiracy belief in Jones et al. 2023) ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=endorsement

Another nuance is the content of conspiracies. In a study by Vukasin Gligorić et al. (2021), NFC correlated positively with a general conspiracy mentality and belief in well-known conspiracy theories, yet NFC was unrelated to COVID-19-specific conspiracies ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=conspiratorial explanation is readily accessible,bias and low statistical power)). This suggests that domain-specific factors (e.g. how new or salient a conspiracy is) may modulate the NFC effect. During the early pandemic, even high-NFC individuals might have still been uncertain which narrative to trust, given the strong presence of official information; thus their NFC did not translate into higher belief in COVID conspiracies ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=conspiratorial

Political Misinformation and Partisan Bias: Beyond classic conspiracies, NFC also plays a role in how people process partisan misinformation (e.g. “fake news” headlines favoring one’s political side). High-NFC individuals are less tolerant of internal conflict and may readily accept information that confirms their pre-existing worldview, thus quickly achieving closure. This can amplify ideological bias in misinformation uptake. For example, conservatives on average score higher in NFC and related traits (like ambiguity intolerance) (). Scholars have suggested this could lead to “disproportionate rates of backfire among people on the political right” () – meaning that when conservative individuals (often high NFC) encounter fact-checks correcting a false but identity-consistent claim, they might double-down on the false claim. However, findings on partisan asymmetry are mixed, and motivated reasoning occurs on both left and right to some extent ().

What is clearer is that analytical cognitive style (as opposed to a quick, closure-driven style) helps inoculate against political fake news. A 2024 meta-analysis of 31 experiments found that individuals with higher analytical thinking skills had significantly better ability to discern true vs false news, whereas those relying on intuition (often associated with a high need for closure) were more prone to errors ([Susceptibility to online misinformation: A systematic meta-analysis of demographic and psychological factors - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39531500/#:~:text=accurate for both true (68.51,news bias (naïvety). We also)). In fact, low need for cognitive reflection – sometimes correlated with high need for closure – is a stronger predictor of falling for partisan “fake news” than partisan bias itself ([The psychological drivers of misinformation belief and its resistance to correction | Nature Reviews Psychology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y#:~:text=48,25%2C 388–402 (2021)) ([The psychological drivers of misinformation belief and its resistance to correction | Nature Reviews Psychology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y#:~:text=50,Cognition 188%2C 39–50 (2019)). Pennycook & Rand (2019) famously described the problem as “lazy, not biased”: many people believe false headlines not because they deliberately want to, but because they don’t put in the cognitive effort to scrutinize them ([The psychological drivers of misinformation belief and its resistance to correction | Nature Reviews Psychology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y#:~:text=50

Resistance to Corrections: When it comes to correcting political misinformation, NFC may also be relevant. Although few studies explicitly test NFC as a moderator of correction effectiveness, theoretical work suggests high-NFC individuals might exhibit a stronger continued influence effect – continuing to rely on debunked misinformation – because accepting the correction leaves a gap in their understanding that they find intolerable ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=studies connecting a need for,Reference Marchlewska%2C Cichocka and Kossowska)). For example, if a false claim (“Ballots were miscounted”) is retracted, someone high in NFC might still cling to it or some alternative narrative unless a satisfying new explanation is provided (“Okay, then why did the initial report say that?”). This dovetails with the recommendation in debunking research that corrections should fill the causal gap left by the misinformation (). High-NFC people especially need that gap filled; otherwise they “report a stronger belief in the original misconception after receiving a retraction,” as seen in some backfire cases () (). While outright “backfire” (belief becoming stronger after correction) is rare, high NFC could increase subtle forms of correction resistance. Future studies are encouraged to “probe the extent to which a high need for closure predisposes individuals to disregard corrections” ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=Marchlewska%2C Cichocka%2C and Kossowska 2018),gaps in their mental models)), as this remains an open question.

In summary, in the political realm high NFC contributes to a fast-and-firm mindset: quick acceptance of congenial claims (even false ones) and stubborn adherence to them. This is moderated by factors like the availability of authoritative information and one’s ideological commitments. Trusted official information can satisfy NFC just as well as misinformation – thus, boosting trust and providing clear factual explanations may help high-NFC individuals find closure in truth rather than falsity ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=Psychological motives related to heightened,van Prooijen%2C 2020)) ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=the same time%2C pre,moderating effect of political trust)).

Health-Related Misinformation (Vaccines and COVID-19)
Health misinformation – such as anti-vaccine myths or bogus COVID-19 remedies – often flourishes in environments of uncertainty and fear. These are precisely the conditions that trigger people’s epistemic needs for certainty, including NFC ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=What makes people believe in,analytical thinking)) ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=Psychological motives related to heightened,van Prooijen%2C 2020)). However, findings in health domains indicate NFC can cut both ways, sometimes increasing susceptibility to false claims, other times offering a degree of protection if the person has already latched onto accurate information.

Vaccine Misinformation: Consider the widely debunked myth linking vaccines to autism. For a parent anxious about their child’s health, this myth is a simple but frightening explanation for autism – one that could be readily accepted if they need closure and lack better answers. Some psychological dispositions (e.g. high sensitivity to disgust or needle phobia) have been linked to greater belief in vaccine misinformation, as they emotionally prime individuals to find anti-vaccine claims plausible. High NFC, by contrast, has shown a somewhat surprising association: in one study, people with higher NFC were *less* likely to be swayed by vaccine misinformation ([How Psychological Factors Play Into Vaccine Misinformation – Texas A&M Stories](https://today.tamu.edu/2020/03/26/how-psychological-factors-play-into-vaccine-misinformation/#:~:text=The analysis found that people,to target their psychological disposition)). Specifically, Callaghan et al. (2020) surveyed U.S. adults on their beliefs about vaccines and then exposed them to tailored pro-vaccine messages. They found that participants high in NFC tended not to endorse the vaccine-autism falsehood as much as others did, even before any intervention ([How Psychological Factors Play Into Vaccine Misinformation – Texas A&M Stories](https://today.tamu.edu/2020/03/26/how-psychological-factors-play-into-vaccine-misinformation/#:~:text=The

It’s worth noting that not all research paints high NFC as a vaccine-misinformation deterrent. Other work suggests high NFC can contribute to general vaccine skepticism indirectly via conspiracy thinking. For example, during COVID-19, belief in vaccine-related conspiracy theories (e.g. about microchips in injections) was more likely among those high in NFC who also had low trust in science ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=Results%3A We find that individuals,moderating effect of political trust)). Here again, trust emerges as a key moderator. Those who trust the medical establishment might satisfy their need for closure with official health guidance; those who distrust it might instead seek closure in fringe explanations. Jedinger and Masch (2025) describe this dynamic in the pandemic context: people “with high levels of NFC will seize on any information that matches their need to reduce uncertainty, regardless of whether they are conspiracy narratives or official explanations” ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=seize on any information that,1991%2C 1993)). In their German sample, however, trust in institutions was so influential that NFC’s direct effect on COVID conspiracy beliefs was minor ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=Results%3A

Coping with Uncertainty and Fear: Health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic illustrate how NFC-driven epistemic processes can influence misinformation uptake in complex ways. On one hand, the pandemic introduced massive uncertainty (a novel virus, unclear risks) that elevated everyone’s need for answers. High-NFC individuals experienced intense pressure to find meaning and predictability ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=Psychological motives related to heightened,van Prooijen%2C 2020)). Some found it in baseless theories (e.g. “the virus is a hoax” or “a bioweapon plot”), which provided a semblance of certainty amidst chaos. On the other hand, misinformation can also serve an emotional function. A recent study by Staszak et al. (2022) found that among people high in certain NFC facets (like avoidance of ambiguity and closed-mindedness), endorsing COVID-19 conspiracy theories actually reduced their fear of the virus ([The Relationship between the Need for Closure and Coronavirus Fear: The Mediating Effect of Beliefs in Conspiracy Theories about COVID-19 - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36429507/#:~:text=scales%3A the Fear of COVID,implications of the research are)) ([The Relationship between the Need for Closure and Coronavirus Fear: The Mediating Effect of Beliefs in Conspiracy Theories about COVID-19 - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36429507/#:~:text=Scale,of the research are discussed)). In other words, believing a reassuring (if false) narrative – for example, “COVID is exaggerated by elites” – helped them cope with anxiety by resolving the threat uncertainty. This was evidenced by a mediation effect: conspiracy beliefs mediated the relationship between NFC traits and lower COVID fear ([The Relationship between the Need for Closure and Coronavirus Fear: The Mediating Effect of Beliefs in Conspiracy Theories about COVID-19 - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36429507/#:~:text=scales%3A

Health Rumors and General False Remedies: Beyond vaccines, NFC may influence susceptibility to various health myths (e.g. “miracle cures” or pseudoscientific claims). There is less direct research here, but parallels from other domains suggest high-NFC people will tend to accept a health claim quickly if it’s the first or most salient explanation they encounter, especially if official information is inconsistent or confusing. If a high-NFC person hears a rumor that a certain herb prevents COVID-19, and authoritative sources are still saying “no known cure” (hence uncertainty), the rumor might stick as their closure-providing answer. However, if clear authoritative debunkings are prominent, high NFC might align with those instead. Indeed, interventions for high-NFC audiences might focus on providing clear, unequivocal corrections and simple factual explanations. One communication study found that tailoring messages to address people’s specific anxieties or needs (including need for closure) improved the effectiveness of misinformation corrections ([How Psychological Factors Play Into Vaccine Misinformation – Texas A&M Stories](https://today.tamu.edu/2020/03/26/how-psychological-factors-play-into-vaccine-misinformation/#:~:text=The analysis found that people,to target their psychological disposition)). For instance, a straightforward article explaining why vaccines do not cause autism (thus directly filling that explanatory void) helped dispel the myth among high-NFC readers by giving them a new, solid understanding to latch onto ([How Psychological Factors Play Into Vaccine Misinformation – Texas A&M Stories](https://today.tamu.edu/2020/03/26/how-psychological-factors-play-into-vaccine-misinformation/#:~:text=The

In summary, in health contexts high NFC can either be a vulnerability (driving people to simplistic falsehoods in the absence of trusted guidance) or a buffer (if they have anchored on scientific consensus early). The key seems to lie in what information becomes their anchor. Ensuring that accurate information is delivered clearly and confidently can satisfy the need for closure in a way that leaves little incentive to seek alternative explanations.

General False Information and Cognitive Phenomena
Beyond specific domains, researchers have examined NFC’s role in general misinformation phenomena – things like the illusory truth effect (repetition-induced belief), memory distortions, and information-processing biases that apply to any topic.

Repetition and “Illusory Truth”: A robust finding in cognitive psychology is that repeated statements feel more true than new ones, even when false. One might expect that individuals who crave closure (NFC) would be especially prone to this effect – perhaps quickly accepting a claim as “true” if it’s familiar, without much scrutiny. Interestingly, studies indicate that the illusory truth effect occurs across the board, largely unaffected by NFC or related traits. De Keersmaecker et al. (2020) explicitly tested whether the boost in perceived truth from repetition varied with cognitive ability, NFC, or cognitive style. They found that repetition increased belief in false statements to a similar degree for everyone, “robust to individual differences in cognitive ability, need for cognitive closure, and cognitive style” ([Investigating the Robustness of the Illusory Truth Effect Across ...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31179863/#:~:text=,cognitive closure%2C and cognitive style)). In other words, high-NFC people are just as susceptible to the subtle influence of repetition as low-NFC people – no more, no less. This suggests that some cognitive biases operate independently of motivational traits; even an open-minded skeptic can fall for a fluently repeated lie, and a closure-seeker is not immune either.

That said, NFC might still affect baseline credibility judgments. While repetition’s relative effect was uniform, high NFC individuals may set a higher default truth rating for familiar information because they tend to trust and commit to initial information. The same 2020 study noted that factors like analytical thinking (often inverse to NFC) correlated with overall accuracy in truth discernment ([The psychological drivers of misinformation belief and its resistance to correction | Nature Reviews Psychology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y#:~:text=50,Cognition 188%2C 39–50 (2019)). Thus, NFC’s influence might manifest in absolute susceptibility (how likely one is to believe false claims in general) rather than in the incremental effect of repetition. In practice, a high-NFC person might believe a false rumor after one exposure, whereas a low-NFC person might only believe it after seeing it multiple times – but eventually both can reach a similar belief strength through the illusory truth effect.

Memory and Continued Influence: Another angle is how NFC affects memory integration of misinformation. In eyewitness memory research, an intriguing finding is that high NFC can exacerbate the misinformation effect – where people incorporate incorrect details into their recollections. One series of experiments showed that high NFC individuals experienced stronger retrieval-induced forgetting of original details, which in turn made them more likely to accept misleading information introduced later ([The Role of Need for Cognitive Closure in Retrieval-Induced ...](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/soco.2014.32.4.337#:~:text=,misinformation effects in eyewitness situations)) ([(PDF) THE ROLE OF NEED FOR COGNITIVE CLOSURE IN ...](https://www.academia.edu/13587424/THE_ROLE_OF_NEED_FOR_COGNITIVE_CLOSURE_IN_RETRIEVAL_INDUCED_FORGETTING_AND_MISINFORMATION_EFFECTS_IN_EYEWITNESS_MEMORY#:~:text=,misinformation effects in eyewitness situations)). Essentially, because high-NFC participants were quick to settle on certain details during recall, they more readily forgot/discarded other details, leaving room for false information to fill the gaps. This aligns with the “freezing” concept: they solidified a subset of information and became less able to retrieve the full picture, so if misinformation was presented, they had fewer original memories to counter it and thus assimilated the false details more easily. While technical, this finding underscores a cognitive mechanism by which need for closure can increase susceptibility: premature cognitive commitment. By closing the case too early on what they remember, high-NFC individuals unintentionally make themselves vulnerable to being misled later.

Analytical vs. Intuitive Thinking: NFC is part of a broader constellation of cognitive style variables. It often correlates negatively with need for cognition (enjoyment of effortful thinking) and with actively open-minded thinking, while correlating positively with impulsivity or mental shortcuts. As such, it’s closely tied to whether someone engages in system 2 (analytic) or system 1 (intuitive) processing. Ample evidence shows that an analytic thinking style is a strong predictor of resisting misinformation across domains ([The psychological drivers of misinformation belief and its resistance to correction | Nature Reviews Psychology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y#:~:text=50,Cognition 188%2C 39–50 (2019)) ([The psychological drivers of misinformation belief and its resistance to correction | Nature Reviews Psychology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y#:~:text=51,27%2C 464–477 (2020)). For example, people who score high on the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) are less likely to believe headlines from false news sites ([The psychological drivers of misinformation belief and its resistance to correction | Nature Reviews Psychology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y#:~:text=50

Media Exposure and Echo Chambers: The modern information environment can either mitigate or worsen the effects of NFC. On social media, for instance, high-NFC users may curate their feeds to exclude sources that provide unwanted ambiguity or contradiction. This selective exposure bolsters their confidence in whatever information they initially embraced. A study by Yang et al. (2019) found a positive relationship between trait NFC and selective exposure to attitude-consistent information – essentially, high-NFC individuals “hide from reality” by filtering out discordant views ([Reconsidering the effects of trait need for closure on information ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656612000815#:~:text=,trait need for)). In the era of algorithm-driven news, this can lead to filter bubbles where a person high in NFC sees only one side of a story, quickly accepts it as truth, and never encounters corrections or opposing evidence. For example, a high-NFC person who falls into an online anti-vaccine community will receive continuous reaffirmation of vaccine myths, satisfying their need for stable belief and making them highly resistant to later factual interventions. Media literacy and diverse exposure thus play a moderating role: exposing high-NFC individuals to multiple perspectives (even if uncomfortable) can prevent premature closure on a false narrative. At the same time, interventions like labeling false content or providing familiar source cues (e.g. a well-known, trusted science source) have shown some success in nudging even heuristic-driven individuals to pause and reconsider misinformation (Susceptibility to online misinformation: A systematic meta-analysis of demographic and psychological factors - PubMed,the design of targeted interventions)).

Moderating Factors and Individual Differences
Throughout the above sections, we’ve touched on several factors that influence how strongly NFC translates into misinformation susceptibility. Here we summarize a few key moderators:

Ideological Orientation: Political ideology intersects with NFC. Conservatives, on average, have higher NFC (), which can partly explain their greater uptake of certain misinformation (e.g. climate change denial or election fraud claims that align with their ideology). However, ideology also provides direction: high-NFC individuals will gravitate to whichever misinformation aligns with their pre-existing beliefs or group narratives. When misinformation congruently reinforces one’s worldview, it faces less scrutiny. Research using signal-detection analysis found that people are more likely to accept headlines as true if those headlines align with their partisan identity (ideological congruency effect) ([Susceptibility to online misinformation: A systematic meta-analysis of demographic and psychological factors - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39531500/#:~:text=accurate for both true (68.51,news bias (naïvety). We also)). For high-NFC partisans, this congruency bias can be even stronger, as they use motivated reasoning to achieve closure that favors their side. Conversely, high-NFC individuals with strong partisan trust in authorities may accept official information more readily, as seen in some cases where NFC correlates with trust in government among certain populations ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=system moderates the link between,of individual differences in NCC)). Thus, ideology and trust can channel the closure motive towards different “truths.”
Cognitive Style and Ability: As discussed, an analytic cognitive style and higher cognitive ability provide a counterweight to NFC’s shortcuts. Somepeople may have high NFC but also high intelligence or education – such individuals might be capable of discerning misinformation, but whether they do so could depend on situational cues. A concept called motivated cognition comes into play: even smart individuals will use their brainpower to rationalize a favored but false view if they are motivated to stick with it (a phenomenon dubbed “motivated System 2” or motivated reflection ([Susceptibility to online misinformation: A systematic meta-analysis of demographic and psychological factors - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39531500/#:~:text=accurate for both true (68.51,news bias (naïvety). We also))). Indeed, recent work found that politically motivated individuals with high reasoning skills could become better at justifying false yet ideologically pleasing beliefs ([Susceptibility to online misinformation: A systematic meta-analysis of demographic and psychological factors - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39531500/#:~:text=accurate
Media Exposure and Information Environment: The context in which one consumes information can moderate NFC’s effect. In a high-choice media environment, a person high in NFC might simply avoid news that could challenge their views, whereas a person low in NFC might tolerate ambiguity by exploring diverse sources. Experiments have shown that when people are made aware of the consequences of selective exposure, some reduce their bias in information selection ([Does Considering the Consequences of Selective Exposure Help ...](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00332941231189214#:~:text=Does Considering the Consequences of,based)) – indicating that even high-NFC individuals can be nudged to seek out disconfirming evidence if motivated appropriately. Social media algorithms can either reinforce or break these habits. If algorithms feed someone only content similar to what they already engaged with, a high-NFC user will rarely confront uncertainty and will become more confident in whatever misinformation they initially believed. On the flip side, product changes like showing fact-check labels or related articles can inject doubt and slow down the closure process, giving corrections a chance to be considered. One meta-review noted that simply displaying the source credibility of news reduced susceptibility to false headlines, particularly among groups that might otherwise trust low-quality sources (Susceptibility to online misinformation: A systematic meta-analysis of demographic and psychological factors - PubMed,the design of targeted interventions)). In short, the design of information platforms can mitigate NFC-driven errors by ensuring that quick closure (“I saw this, it must be true”) is discouraged through friction or contextual information.
Emotional States: While not a focus of the question, it bears mentioning that fear and anxiety can amplify the need for closure. Studies during COVID-19 showed that when people feel threatened, those high in NFC especially seek out narratives – sometimes conspiratorial – that alleviate their anxiety ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=Psychological motives related to heightened,van Prooijen%2C 2020)) ([The Relationship between the Need for Closure and Coronavirus Fear: The Mediating Effect of Beliefs in Conspiracy Theories about COVID-19 - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36429507/#:~:text=Scale,of the research are discussed)). Emotional distress can thus heighten the impact of NFC on misinformation adoption. Conversely, inducing a sense of security or providing reassuring explanations might reduce the frantic search for closure. This is tangential but relevant: any interventions to combat misinformation among high-NFC audiences may work better if they also address the emotional discomfort of uncertainty (for example, by acknowledging uncertainties frankly but framing what is being done to resolve them, so that the audience doesn’t feel in the dark).
Summary of Key Studies and Findings
To synthesize the research, the table below highlights notable studies on NFC and misinformation across different domains, along with their key findings:

Study (Year)	Domain / Context	Key Findings on NFC and Misinformation
Marchlewska et al. (2018)	Unexplained events (political/general)	High NFC fostered conspiracy beliefs when no official explanation was available. In experiments, NFC positively predicted endorsing conspiratorial causes of a refugee crisis and a plane crash only when no clear official account was provided. When an authoritative explanation existed, high-NFC individuals were less prone to conspiracy theories (). Conclusion: High NFC “seizes” on conspiracies for ambiguous events, but will accept official explanations if they satisfy uncertainty ().
**Imhoff & Bruder (2014)**Leman & Cinnirella (2013)	General conspiracy beliefs	These studies found no significant correlation between dispositional NFC and general conspiracy belief propensity ([Frontiers

Callaghan et al. (2020)	Vaccine misinformation (U.S.)	In surveys and an experiment on MMR vaccine myths, individuals with high NFC were less likely to endorse vaccine misinformation (e.g. the autism myth) ([How Psychological Factors Play Into Vaccine Misinformation – Texas A&M Stories](https://today.tamu.edu/2020/03/26/how-psychological-factors-play-into-vaccine-misinformation/#:~:text=The analysis found that people,to target their psychological disposition)). High NFC respondents showed greater resistance to false vaccine claims compared to those high in needle anxiety or purity concerns. Tailored factual messages further reduced misinformation belief in other groups, but high-NFC folks were already relatively skeptical of the falsehood ([How Psychological Factors Play Into Vaccine Misinformation – Texas A&M Stories](https://today.tamu.edu/2020/03/26/how-psychological-factors-play-into-vaccine-misinformation/#:~:text=The

Repeated statements were rated more true than new ones by both high- and low-NFC individuals. This indicates that basic cognitive biases in misinformation perception (like familiarity = truth) operate robustly across individual differences, including need for closure ([Investigating the Robustness of the Illusory Truth Effect Across ...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31179863/#:~:text=

High-NFC individuals, disliking gaps in knowledge, may stick with the original false explanation unless a correction provides an equally satisfying alternative. Empirical studies (to be done) should test if high NFC indeed correlates with poorer updating after corrections ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=Marchlewska%2C Cichocka%2C and Kossowska 2018),gaps in their mental models)).

Conclusion
In conclusion, the need for closure plays a significant but nuanced role in individuals’ susceptibility to misinformation. Theoretical models propose that high NFC creates a cognitive “fast lane” to belief – favoring quick, definite answers and discouraging second-guessing – which can be a recipe for accepting misinformation that provides a tidy explanation ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=Consequently%2C individuals with a high,Need for)) ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=studies connecting a need for,Reference Marchlewska%2C Cichocka and Kossowska)). Empirical research across domains largely supports this: high-NFC people often show a slight predisposition to believe conspiracy theories and simplistic false claims, especially in uncertain situations ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=Webster ,2018)) ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=Results%3A We find that individuals,moderating effect of political trust)). They tend to cling to initial information (true or false), making them less responsive to corrections or new evidence that would reopen questions ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=Consequently%2C

However, the relationship is not absolute. High NFC does not doom someone to be misinformed – much depends on the information environment and the content that initially satisfies their need for closure. If accurate information is readily available, authoritative, and satisfying, high-NFC individuals can just as readily latch onto the truth and become staunch defenders of it (as seen with some high-NFC people rejecting vaccine myths and sticking to expert consensus) ([How Psychological Factors Play Into Vaccine Misinformation – Texas A&M Stories](https://today.tamu.edu/2020/03/26/how-psychological-factors-play-into-vaccine-misinformation/#:~:text=The analysis found that people,to target their psychological disposition)). Additionally, not all forms of misinformation exploitation are amplified by NFC – certain cognitive biases (like the illusory truth from repetition) affect most people equally ([Investigating the Robustness of the Illusory Truth Effect Across ...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31179863/#:~:text=,cognitive closure%2C and cognitive style)). And some studies find only negligible or context-dependent effects of NFC on belief, reminding us that other factors (e.g. trust, ideology, emotional needs) often overshadow NFC’s direct influence ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=Results%3A We find that individuals,moderating effect of political trust)) ([Frontiers | Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/social-psychology/articles/10.3389/frsps.2024.1447313/full#:~:text=endorsement of conspiracy theories are,an official account of the)).

Moderators such as cognitive style, media exposure, and ideology critically shape the NFC-misinformation link. An analytic, reflective mindset can counteract the impulsive closure-seeking tendency, reducing susceptibility to fake news ([The psychological drivers of misinformation belief and its resistance to correction | Nature Reviews Psychology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y#:~:text=50,Cognition 188%2C 39–50 (2019)). Media and social networks can either lock high-NFC individuals into echo chambers that reinforce their false beliefs, or they can expose them to corrective information in a digestible way. And ideological or cultural orientations can direct which misinformation a person finds appealing (for example, a conspiracy that aligns with one’s political distrust). These moderating influences mean that interventions to combat misinformation can be tailored: for high-NFC audiences, strategies that provide clear, coherent explanations (leaving minimal ambiguity) and that come from trusted sources may be most effective in preempting the allure of false narratives ([How Psychological Factors Play Into Vaccine Misinformation – Texas A&M Stories](https://today.tamu.edu/2020/03/26/how-psychological-factors-play-into-vaccine-misinformation/#:~:text=The analysis found that people,to target their psychological disposition)) (Susceptibility to online misinformation: A systematic meta-analysis of demographic and psychological factors - PubMed,the design of targeted interventions)). Conversely, debunking approaches should be careful to fill knowledge gaps; simply saying “that’s false” without an alternative explanation may not satisfy someone with high need for closure ([Misinformation and Its Correction (Chapter 8) - Social Media and Democracy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/misinformation-and-its-correction/61FA7FD743784A723BA234533012E810#:~:text=studies connecting a need for,Reference Marchlewska%2C Cichocka and Kossowska)).

In sum, need for closure is a double-edged sword in the misinformation age. It drives people to make sense of chaos – an understandable impulse – but in doing so, it can lead them down the path of “premature sense-making” via misinformation. Understanding this psychology, supported by both foundational theories and recent studies, allows us to better predict who might fall for fake news and why, and to design better communication strategies (such as meta-cognitive prompts or tailored fact-checks) to address those vulnerabilities. The research field is evolving, with meta-analyses beginning to parse the relative weight of different factors. While NFC is just one piece of the puzzle, it is a theoretically rich piece that connects motivated reasoning, cognitive processing, and the social spread of falsehoods – thereby offering valuable insights into how minds close around misinformation and how we might gently pry them back open to the truth.
