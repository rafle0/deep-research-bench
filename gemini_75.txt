Modulating Plasma Metal Ion Concentrations: A Critical Evaluation of Preventive and Therapeutic Strategies for Cardiovascular Disease
1. Introduction
Overview of Metal Ion Importance
Metal ions are fundamental chemical elements indispensable for all known forms of life.1 They are not synthesized or degraded biologically; thus, their concentrations and distribution within organisms are maintained through tightly regulated processes of absorption, transport, storage, and excretion, collectively known as homeostasis.2 Metal ions participate in a vast array of biological processes critical for maintaining health. They serve structural roles within biomolecules, act as catalytic cofactors for a significant proportion of enzymes (estimated at over 40% of known enzymes), facilitate electron transfer in metabolic pathways like respiration, and function as signaling molecules in intra- and intercellular communication.1 It is estimated that approximately half of all proteins require a metal ion for their function, forming metalloproteins.5 Specifically within the cardiovascular system, metal ions are essential for nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction (including the rhythmic beating of the heart), maintenance of electrochemical gradients across cell membranes, oxygen transport and storage, and mitochondrial energy production.1 Essential metals include macronutrient cations like sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as well as trace elements such as iron, zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium.5

Metal Ion Homeostasis and Dysregulation
Maintaining the delicate balance of metal ion concentrations is crucial, as both deficiency and excess can lead to profound cellular dysfunction.5 Metal ion homeostasis involves intricate networks controlling their uptake from the diet, distribution to various tissues and cellular compartments (including mitochondria, which are heavily reliant on specific metal ion transporters 6), storage in specialized proteins (like ferritin for iron), and elimination primarily via renal or gastrointestinal routes.2 Disruptions in this homeostasis, whether due to inadequate intake, impaired absorption, excessive losses, genetic defects, or exposure to environmental contaminants, can perturb critical biochemical pathways.9 A key mechanism through which metal ion imbalance impacts cellular health is the disruption of redox homeostasis â€“ the balance between pro-oxidants (like reactive oxygen species, ROS) and antioxidants.9 Transition metals such as iron and copper, while essential for their ability to participate in electron transfer reactions, can also catalyze the formation of highly damaging ROS (e.g., hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction) if present in excessive amounts or in inappropriate cellular locations.2 Conversely, deficiencies of antioxidant metals like magnesium, zinc, copper, or selenium can impair the cell's ability to neutralize ROS.3 This resulting oxidative stress, along with associated inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, is increasingly recognized as a central contributor to the pathophysiology of numerous diseases, including a wide spectrum of cardiovascular disorders.9 The complexity of metal-protein interactions and their downstream effects on biological networks, however, remains incompletely understood.4

Rationale for Exploring Metal Ion Modulation
Disturbances in the equilibrium of various metal ions are frequently observed in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), correlating with impaired cardiac function and disease progression.3 For instance, iron deficiency is highly prevalent in heart failure 19, while exposure to contaminant metals like lead and cadmium is linked to increased hypertension and atherosclerosis risk.17 This association between metal ion dysregulation and CVD provides a rationale for investigating whether interventions aimed at modulating plasma and tissue metal ion concentrations could represent viable preventive or therapeutic strategies. Compared to some conventional pharmaceuticals, metal ions offer potential advantages such as broad availability, inherent stability, and potentially favorable safety profiles when used appropriately.3 Strategies proposed include dietary modification, oral or intravenous supplementation with essential minerals found to be deficient, and chelation therapy to remove excess or toxic metals.3

2. Biological Roles and Pathophysiology of Metal Ions in the Cardiovascular System
General Principles
Metal ions are integral to life, acting as indispensable cofactors for a vast number of enzymes and participating in over half of all known metabolic pathways.3 Their unique chemical properties enable them to facilitate complex biochemical reactions, including redox processes critical for energy metabolism and antioxidant defense.1 They play structural roles, stabilizing the conformation of proteins and nucleic acids, and are essential for signal transduction cascades that regulate cellular function.1 Mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, are particularly dependent on precise metal ion transport and homeostasis (including Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Fe2+/Fe3+) for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), ATP production, maintaining membrane integrity, and regulating processes like apoptosis.6 Consequently, mitochondrial metal ion dysregulation is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases.6

A crucial aspect of metal ion biology is the interconnectedness of their homeostatic mechanisms. Imbalances in one metal ion can frequently influence the status and function of others, often converging on common downstream pathophysiological pathways. Oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction emerge as recurrent themes linked to the dysregulation of diverse metal ions, including iron overload 15, copper excess 20, magnesium deficiency 21, and heavy metal toxicity.17 This convergence suggests that while the initiating imbalance may be ion-specific, the resulting cellular damage often involves shared mechanisms. This implies that therapies targeting these common pathways might have broader applicability, but also highlights the complexity of predicting the net effect of modulating a single ion within this interconnected network.

Furthermore, transition metals like iron and copper exhibit a critical duality. Their ability to readily gain or lose electrons (redox activity) is essential for their roles in enzymatic catalysis and electron transport chains.2 However, this same chemical property makes them potent catalysts for the generation of damaging ROS through reactions like the Fenton reaction when their concentrations are not tightly controlled or when they exist in a "free" or inappropriately bound state.2 Both deficiency (which can impair antioxidant enzymes) and excess (which can directly generate ROS) can lead to oxidative damage.7 This inherent redox duality complicates therapeutic approaches aimed at simply increasing or decreasing their levels, demanding precise control to maintain concentrations within a narrow physiological window to avoid iatrogenic harm.

Essential Macronutrient Cations
Calcium (Ca)
Calcium ions are fundamentally involved in cardiovascular physiology. As the primary charge carrier during the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential (the "slow inward current"), Ca2+ influx is essential for triggering excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes.23 Beyond contraction, Ca2+ acts as a ubiquitous second messenger, regulating a multitude of cellular processes including neurotransmitter release, enzyme activities, gene expression, cell growth, and apoptosis.5 It also plays a vital role in blood coagulation and contributes to maintaining the stability and permeability of cell membranes.23

Pathophysiologically, disturbances in calcium homeostasis are central to many cardiovascular disease processes. Chronic intracellular Ca2+ overload, often resulting from dysfunctional transport mechanisms across the plasma membrane or intracellular organelles like the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, is a hallmark of conditions like cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.23 This overload can lead to impaired myocardial relaxation (diastolic dysfunction), trigger pro-hypertrophic signaling pathways, promote electrical instability leading to arrhythmias, and contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death.9 Furthermore, dysregulated calcium handling can contribute to vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, and potentially vascular calcification, a key feature of atherosclerosis.24 Intriguingly, recent Mendelian randomization studies suggest that even variations in serum calcium levels within the conventionally defined normal range may be causally associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction.26

Magnesium (Mg)
Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation and a critical cofactor for over 600 enzymatic reactions, many of which involve ATP hydrolysis and synthesis, making it indispensable for cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.3 Mg2+ plays a key role in regulating the function of various ion channels, including those for calcium, potassium, and sodium. By modulating these channels, magnesium influences cell membrane excitability, neuromuscular transmission, vascular smooth muscle tone, and cardiac rhythm.12 It acts as a physiological calcium antagonist, competing for binding sites and modulating Ca2+ influx and intracellular signaling, which contributes to its vasodilatory and anti-arrhythmic properties.27 Magnesium is also involved in maintaining endothelial function and has roles in hemostasis, impacting both coagulation proteins and platelet activity.8

Magnesium deficiency, particularly chronic latent deficiency which may persist without overt symptoms, is increasingly recognized as a contributor to cardiovascular risk.12 Mechanistically, inadequate magnesium status is linked to a pro-inflammatory state (characterized by elevated CRP and inflammatory cytokines), increased oxidative stress (due to impaired mitochondrial function and reduced antioxidant capacity), dyslipidemia, and endothelial dysfunction (potentially via reduced nitric oxide bioavailability).12 Furthermore, magnesium deficiency disrupts the cellular balance of other electrolytes, often leading to increased intracellular calcium and depletion of intracellular potassium, which can promote vasoconstriction, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and platelet aggregation.12 Epidemiological studies consistently show an inverse relationship between magnesium intake or serum levels and the prevalence of hypertension, coronary artery calcification, stroke, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes.8 Hypomagnesemia is a common finding in patients hospitalized with cardiovascular conditions, particularly heart failure, and is associated with a worse prognosis.29

Potassium (K)
Potassium is the most abundant intracellular cation and the primary determinant of the resting membrane potential in most cells, including cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells.5 This electrochemical gradient is crucial for maintaining cellular excitability, nerve impulse transmission, and muscle contraction. Potassium homeostasis is tightly regulated, primarily by the kidneys.32 Dietary potassium intake significantly influences blood pressure regulation. Higher potassium intake promotes sodium excretion (natriuresis) via mechanisms involving the renal "potassium switch" â€“ specifically, the modulation of the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) activity in the distal convoluted tubule.33 Increased plasma potassium leads to NCC inactivation, reducing sodium reabsorption and lowering blood pressure.33 Potassium also directly influences vascular tone, with higher levels promoting vasodilation through hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle cells.33

Low dietary potassium intake, a common feature of Western diets which are often high in sodium and low in fruits and vegetables, is strongly associated with increased blood pressure and a higher risk of stroke.32 Hypokalemia (serum K+ <3.5-3.8 mmol/L, depending on laboratory range) can arise from inadequate intake, excessive gastrointestinal losses, or the use of certain medications like loop and thiazide diuretics.32 It is a common electrolyte disturbance, particularly in hospitalized patients, and significantly increases the risk of potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias due to alterations in myocardial repolarization.32

Essential Trace Elements
Iron (Fe)
Iron is an essential transition metal absolutely critical for cardiovascular function due to its central role in oxygen transport (as part of hemoglobin in red blood cells) and oxygen storage (as myoglobin in muscle cells).7 It is a key component of heme proteins and iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters within the mitochondrial electron transport chain, making it indispensable for cellular respiration and ATP production, processes vital for the high energy demands of the heart.6 Iron is also required for DNA synthesis and the catalytic activity of numerous enzymes.9

Iron deficiency (ID) is remarkably common in patients with chronic heart failure, affecting 50% or more, and its prevalence increases with HF severity.19 ID in HF can be absolute (depleted total body iron stores) or functional (adequate stores but impaired iron mobilization and utilization, often due to inflammation increasing hepcidin levels).7 Importantly, the adverse consequences of ID in HF occur even in the absence of anemia.19 ID impairs mitochondrial function, reduces myocardial energy production, hinders cardiomyocyte contractility, and is independently associated with worse symptoms (fatigue, dyspnea), reduced exercise capacity, poorer quality of life, increased hospitalizations, and higher mortality rates in HF patients.7 Contributing factors include poor dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption (due to inflammation, congestion, or medications altering gastric acidity), and increased blood loss (e.g., from anti-thrombotic therapy or gastrointestinal lesions).19

Conversely, iron overload is also detrimental to the cardiovascular system.7 The heart is particularly vulnerable because mammalian cells possess multiple iron import mechanisms but only a single known exporter, ferroportin.7 Conditions like hereditary hemochromatosis or chronic blood transfusions can lead to excessive iron accumulation in cardiomyocytes.7 Excess intracellular iron catalyzes the formation of ROS via the Fenton reaction, leading to significant oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage, inflammation, and fibrosis.7 This can result in progressive cardiac dysfunction, including cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and heart failure.11 Ferroptosis, a specific form of iron-dependent regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various CVDs associated with iron dysregulation.7

Zinc (Zn)
Zinc is a ubiquitous trace element essential for a vast array of cellular functions. It serves as a catalytic or structural component for hundreds of enzymes and thousands of transcription factors (including zinc fingers involved in DNA binding).3 Unlike iron and copper, zinc itself is redox-inert under physiological conditions but plays a crucial role in antioxidant defense by being a component of the key antioxidant enzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and by inducing the synthesis of metallothioneins, which sequester free radicals.1 Zinc is also vital for immune system function, cell growth and differentiation, DNA synthesis, wound healing, and maintaining the integrity of the vascular endothelium.13

Zinc deficiency, estimated to affect a significant portion of the global population, is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.13 Mechanistically, Zn deficiency compromises antioxidant defenses, leading to increased oxidative stress and inflammation (evidenced by higher levels of inflammatory cytokines like TNF-Î± and IL-6).13 It can impair endothelial function, potentially through disruption of nitric oxide signaling, and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.13 Low zinc status has also been linked to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and impaired cardiac development.10 Clinical studies and meta-analyses suggest an association between lower zinc levels or intake and increased risk of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and overall CVD mortality.13 However, excessive zinc intake can also pose risks, primarily by interfering with the absorption and metabolism of copper, potentially leading to copper deficiency and adverse effects on lipid profiles, such as decreased HDL cholesterol.13 Some studies have also linked higher zinc levels or a high Zn/Cu ratio to unfavorable metabolic markers like elevated HbA1c and triglycerides, although potentially associated with lower fibrinogen.44

Copper (Cu)
Copper is another essential transition metal that cycles between cuprous (Cu+) and cupric (Cu2+) states, enabling its participation in critical redox reactions.2 It is a vital cofactor for several key enzymes involved in cardiovascular health, including cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), the terminal enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain essential for ATP production 20; Cu/Zn-SOD, a major antioxidant enzyme 20; lysyl oxidase, required for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin in connective tissues, maintaining vascular integrity 2; and ceruloplasmin and hephaestin, ferroxidases necessary for iron transport and metabolism.2

Copper deficiency, although less common than iron or zinc deficiency, can have severe cardiovascular consequences. Impaired CCO activity due to copper shortage leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced energy production in cardiomyocytes.20 Reduced Cu/Zn-SOD activity compromises antioxidant defenses.20 Defective lysyl oxidase function can weaken blood vessel walls, potentially leading to aneurysms, while impaired iron metabolism can contribute to anemia.2 Clinical manifestations of copper deficiency can include cardiac hypertrophy, electrocardiographic abnormalities, arrhythmias, impaired left ventricular function, dyslipidemia, and an increased susceptibility to ischemic heart disease.20

Copper excess is also toxic. Like iron, free or excess copper can catalyze the formation of ROS, leading to oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage.2 Excess copper can disrupt mitochondrial function by interfering with the TCA cycle and promoting protein aggregation.20 It can also induce inflammation (e.g., via NF-ÎºB activation), impair endothelial function by altering nitric oxide balance, promote the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, and trigger a specific form of cell death termed cuproptosis.20 Elevated serum copper levels have been associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure in epidemiological studies.20

Selenium (Se)
Selenium exerts its biological functions primarily through its incorporation into a unique class of proteins known as selenoproteins.14 Key examples include the glutathione peroxidases (GPx), which reduce hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides, and thioredoxin reductases, which regenerate antioxidants like thioredoxin; both play critical roles in protecting cells against oxidative damage.14 Selenoproteins are also involved in redox signaling and thyroid hormone metabolism.14

Severe selenium deficiency is known to cause Keshan disease, an endemic cardiomyopathy primarily affecting children and women in selenium-poor regions.14 Whether milder selenium deficiency contributes significantly to cardiovascular risk in other populations is less clear. Some observational studies have suggested an inverse association between selenium status (measured by blood or toenail levels) and the risk of coronary heart disease.14 However, this evidence is inconsistent, and confounding factors may play a role.14 Conversely, excessive selenium intake or supplementation in populations already replete with selenium does not appear to confer cardiovascular benefits and may even pose risks. Notably, some large trials and observational studies have raised concerns about a potential link between high selenium status or supplementation and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.48 Some data suggest a U-shaped relationship between selenium intake and certain cardiovascular risk markers, implying potential harm at both low and high levels of exposure.43

Contaminant Heavy Metals
Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Arsenic (As)
Unlike essential minerals, heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and arsenic serve no known beneficial physiological function in humans and are recognized environmental and occupational toxins.17 Exposure occurs through various routes, including contaminated air, water, soil, and food (e.g., Cd in cereals and vegetables grown in contaminated soil, As in contaminated water or rice), industrial processes, tobacco smoke (a major source of Cd), and deteriorating lead-based paint.17 Cadmium is particularly insidious as it accumulates in the body, especially the kidneys, over a lifetime due to its very long biological half-life and inefficient excretion.51

These contaminant metals exert their toxicity by interfering with numerous fundamental cellular processes.18 A primary mechanism involves the induction of oxidative stress through the generation of ROS and the depletion of cellular antioxidant defenses.17 They also promote chronic inflammation, disrupt normal cellular ion homeostasis (potentially displacing essential minerals like calcium and zinc from binding sites), impair endothelial function, cause dyslipidemia, induce epigenetic modifications that alter gene expression, and directly affect myocardial electrical activity and contractility.17

Accumulating evidence from epidemiological, clinical, and basic science studies strongly links chronic exposure to lead, cadmium, and arsenic to an increased risk of a wide range of cardiovascular diseases.17 These include hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, subclinical and clinical atherosclerosis (including coronary artery stenosis and calcification), ischemic heart disease, stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and peripheral artery disease.17 The American Heart Association (AHA) issued a Scientific Statement in 2023 explicitly identifying these contaminant metals as significant, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.18 The statement emphasizes that public health measures aimed at reducing environmental exposure to these metals have been associated with demonstrable reductions in cardiovascular mortality.18 Critically, the burden of exposure and subsequent risk is often disproportionately borne by populations of color and those with lower socioeconomic status, contributing to health disparities.18 The clear and consistent evidence of harm from these non-essential metals, coupled with their known toxic mechanisms converging on pathways central to CVD (oxidative stress, inflammation), positions them distinctly from essential minerals where the goal is balance. For contaminant metals, the objective is minimization of exposure and potentially removal via chelation, representing a potentially important, yet often underappreciated, target for CVD prevention.17

3. Therapeutic Interventions Targeting Metal Ion Status
Dietary and Supplemental Approaches
Magnesium (Mg) Supplementation
The rationale for exploring magnesium supplementation stems from the high prevalence of inadequate dietary intake in many populations 12 and the numerous mechanistic links between magnesium deficiency and established CVD risk factors, including hypertension, inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, and arrhythmias.12 Observational studies generally support an inverse association between magnesium intake or serum levels and the incidence of various CVDs.22

Clinical trial evidence regarding the efficacy of magnesium supplementation is somewhat mixed, particularly for hard cardiovascular endpoints. For blood pressure, several meta-analyses of RCTs have been conducted. Some suggest a modest but statistically significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with magnesium supplementation, potentially in a dose-dependent manner or being more effective when combined with increased potassium and reduced sodium intake.28 However, other large meta-analyses have found no significant overall effect on blood pressure.28 Individual trials often show small reductions, for example, 2.5/1.4 mmHg in 24-hour ambulatory BP with 20 mmol/day.28 Regarding arrhythmias, a meta-analysis focusing on the post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) setting indicated that intravenous magnesium sulfate administration significantly reduced the incidence of both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias compared to placebo.53 This aligns with magnesium's known roles in stabilizing cell membranes and acting as a calcium antagonist.12 For other risk factors, supplementation has shown potential to reduce markers of inflammation like C-reactive protein (CRP) 22 and to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, particularly in individuals with type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes who are also magnesium deficient.29 Effects on lipid profiles are less consistent, though some studies suggest improvements in HDL cholesterol.29

Overall, while biologically plausible mechanisms and supportive observational data exist, robust RCT evidence demonstrating that magnesium supplementation alone prevents major cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, CVD death) in the general population is currently lacking. Supplementation appears most promising for specific indications like managing certain arrhythmias (post-ACS) or improving metabolic parameters in deficient individuals, and potentially contributing to modest blood pressure reduction, especially as part of a broader dietary strategy.

Potassium (K) Supplementation/Intake
The rationale for increasing potassium intake is strongly supported by the well-established inverse relationship between potassium consumption and blood pressure levels, as well as stroke risk.33 Modern diets are often characterized by high sodium and low potassium content, contributing to the prevalence of hypertension.32

The evidence for the blood pressure-lowering effect of increased potassium intake, achieved through either dietary changes (like the DASH diet, rich in fruits and vegetables) or potassium chloride supplements, is robust and consistent across numerous RCTs and meta-analyses.33 A WHO systematic review reported an average BP reduction of 5.9/3.8 mmHg with increased potassium intake 33, while another meta-analysis focusing on hypertensive subjects found reductions of 4.48 mmHg systolic and 2.96 mmHg diastolic with supplementation.55 The effect is particularly pronounced in individuals with existing hypertension and those consuming high amounts of sodium.35 Some analyses suggest the greatest BP reduction occurs with achieved intakes around 90-120 mmol/day.35 The magnitude of BP lowering can be comparable to that achieved with a single antihypertensive medication.28

Regarding cardiovascular outcomes, meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies consistently demonstrate that higher potassium intake is associated with a significantly lower risk of incident stroke, with relative risk reductions estimated at around 21-24%.33 The landmark Salt Substitute and Stroke Study (SSaSS) RCT further supports this, showing that replacing regular salt with a potassium-enriched salt substitute significantly reduced the rates of stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality.33 Evidence linking higher potassium intake to a reduced risk of coronary heart disease or total cardiovascular disease has been less consistent in some meta-analyses.34

Overall, there is strong, high-quality evidence supporting recommendations to increase potassium intake, preferably through dietary sources rich in potassium, for the prevention and management of hypertension and the reduction of stroke risk. Supplemental potassium chloride is also effective for BP lowering.

Selenium (Se) Supplementation
Interest in selenium supplementation for CVD prevention arose from its role as an essential component of antioxidant selenoproteins, such as glutathione peroxidases 14, and some early observational studies suggesting an inverse association between selenium status and coronary heart disease risk.14

However, rigorous evaluation through RCTs has largely failed to support this hypothesis. A comprehensive Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis, pooling data from available RCTs (predominantly involving well-nourished participants from the US), found no statistically significant effect of selenium-only supplementation on primary prevention outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal cardiovascular events, or combined cardiovascular events.48 The quality of the evidence was limited by the number and heterogeneity of trials, but the overall conclusion was a lack of demonstrable benefit.48 Effects on cardiovascular risk factors were also unimpressive; while some analyses hinted at small, non-significant reductions in total or non-HDL cholesterol, HDL levels were unchanged, and no trials reported effects on blood pressure.48

Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential adverse effects of selenium supplementation, particularly an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. While meta-analyses did not find a statistically significant increase in diabetes risk overall, the possibility could not be definitively ruled out, especially in individuals with adequate or high baseline selenium status.48 The large SELECT trial also reported higher rates of alopecia and dermatitis with selenium supplementation.48

In summary, the current body of evidence from RCTs does not support the routine use of selenium supplements for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Given the lack of proven benefit and potential risks (particularly concerning diabetes), supplementation is likely unnecessary and possibly ill-advised for individuals who are already well-nourished and have adequate selenium intake from their diet.49

Calcium (Ca) Supplementation
Calcium supplements are widely used, primarily with the goal of improving bone health and preventing osteoporosis, particularly in postmenopausal women and older adults.25 While essential for bone mineralization, the role of calcium supplementation in cardiovascular health is highly controversial.25 Some studies suggest a potential modest benefit on blood pressure, with meta-analyses indicating small reductions in systolic (~1.4 mmHg) and diastolic (~0.8-1.0 mmHg) BP, particularly in younger individuals or with higher doses.25

The major controversy surrounds the potential for calcium supplements (often taken with vitamin D) to increase the risk of cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction.26 This concern emerged primarily from secondary analyses and meta-analyses of RCTs originally designed to assess fracture outcomes. Bolland and colleagues reported meta-analyses suggesting an approximately 15-30% increased risk of MI or a composite CVD endpoint associated with calcium supplementation, particularly in healthy postmenopausal women.57 Mechanistic plausibility exists, as calcium supplements, especially when taken fasting, cause acute, transient increases in serum calcium concentrations, which have been linked to temporary increases in blood coagulability, vascular calcification propensity, and blood pressure.26 However, other large RCTs (like the primary analysis of the Women's Health Initiative - WHI) and different meta-analyses have not found a significant association between calcium supplementation and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.25 It is noteworthy that higher dietary calcium intake does not appear to carry the same potential risk and may even be protective.25 Mendelian randomization studies, which use genetic variants as proxies for exposure, have lent support to the hypothesis that higher circulating calcium levels (even within the normal range) are causally linked to increased CVD risk.26

Current clinical guidelines primarily focus on achieving adequate total daily calcium intake (typically 1000-1200 mg/day for older adults) for skeletal health, strongly emphasizing obtaining this calcium from dietary sources whenever possible.25 While acknowledging the ongoing controversy regarding cardiovascular safety, most guidelines do not explicitly advise against supplementation if required to meet these targets, implying a judgment that the benefits for bone health outweigh the potential cardiovascular risks at recommended intake levels.25

Overall, calcium supplementation is unlikely to provide significant cardiovascular benefits beyond a very small effect on blood pressure. Its safety remains debated, with conflicting trial data but plausible mechanisms for potential harm. A prudent approach involves prioritizing dietary calcium sources and using supplements judiciously, only when necessary to achieve recommended intakes for bone health, possibly favoring lower doses taken with meals to minimize acute fluctuations in serum calcium.

The varying levels of evidence and differing conclusions for supplementation with Mg, K, Se, and Ca underscore that a one-size-fits-all approach is inappropriate. The utility of mineral supplementation for CVD is highly dependent on the specific mineral, the patient population (e.g., presence of deficiency, baseline risk, comorbidities), and the clinical endpoint of interest. Potassium stands out for its clear benefits on blood pressure and stroke prevention.33 Magnesium shows potential, particularly for arrhythmias and in deficient states, but requires more definitive evidence for major CVD event reduction.31 Selenium lacks support for primary prevention in replete populations 49, while calcium's role is primarily skeletal, shadowed by cardiovascular safety concerns regarding supplements.26 Benefit often appears greatest when addressing a documented or likely deficiency (e.g., Mg, K effects stronger at lower baseline intakes 55), highlighting the importance of targeted, rather than indiscriminate, supplementation strategies.

Iron Status Management in Cardiovascular Disease
Iron Deficiency (ID) in Heart Failure (HF)
Iron deficiency is a highly prevalent and clinically significant comorbidity in patients with heart failure, affecting up to 50-55% of stable ambulatory patients and as many as 70-80% of those hospitalized for acute decompensation.19 This deficiency, defined typically by serum ferritin <100 Î¼g/L, or ferritin 100-299 Î¼g/L with transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20%, exerts detrimental effects independent of the presence of anemia.39 The pathophysiology involves impaired mitochondrial energy production, reduced oxygen carrying capacity and utilization, and diminished cardiomyocyte contractility, all contributing to the core symptoms of HF.7 Clinically, ID in HF is robustly associated with reduced exercise capacity, poorer health-related quality of life (QoL), increased rates of HF hospitalization, and higher mortality.19

Interventions aimed at correcting ID in HF have primarily focused on intravenous (IV) iron preparations, as oral iron has proven largely ineffective, likely due to poor absorption (often exacerbated by inflammation and gut edema in HF) and significant gastrointestinal side effects limiting adherence.7 Several landmark RCTs have evaluated IV iron, predominantly ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) or ferric derisomaltose (FDI). Early trials like FAIR-HF and CONFIRM-HF established that IV FCM significantly improves patient symptoms (NYHA class), QoL (measured by KCCQ), and exercise capacity (6-minute walk test distance, peak VO2) compared to placebo in symptomatic patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and ID.39

Subsequent larger trials aimed to determine if these functional improvements translated into better clinical outcomes, specifically reductions in hospitalizations and mortality.

AFFIRM-AHF randomized patients hospitalized for acute HF (LVEF <50%) with ID to receive IV FCM or placebo starting before discharge.38 It found a significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint of total (first and recurrent) HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular (CV) death, primarily driven by a reduction in HF hospitalizations. There was no significant difference in CV death or all-cause mortality alone.38
IRONMAN enrolled stable chronic HF patients (LVEF â‰¤45%) with ID, mostly outpatients but including some recently hospitalized, and used IV FDI.38 The primary analysis showed a trend towards reduction in the composite of HF hospitalization or CV death that did not reach statistical significance, although pre-specified sensitivity analyses accounting for COVID-19 pandemic disruptions were positive. Again, no significant effect on mortality alone was observed.59 The trial was potentially limited by high crossover use of non-protocol IV iron in the control group.38
HEART-FID, the largest trial to date, enrolled stable chronic HFrEF patients (LVEF â‰¤40%) with ID and used IV FCM.39 It employed a hierarchical composite primary endpoint (all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, change in 6MWT distance at 12 months). The trial showed a modest, but not statistically significant, difference favoring FCM for this composite endpoint. A pre-specified analysis showed a potentially clinically meaningful, though not statistically significant, trend towards lower all-cause mortality at 12 months in the FCM group (HR 0.82).61 Key predictors of mortality identified were baseline NT-proBNP, country of enrollment, and 6MWT distance.61
Meta-analyses incorporating data from these and earlier trials consistently demonstrate that IV iron significantly reduces the risk of recurrent HF hospitalizations (Rate Ratio ~0.75-0.77) and the composite of HF hospitalization or CV death (Rate Ratio ~0.81) in patients with HFrEF/HFmrEF and ID.59 The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one composite event or HF hospitalization over approximately one year is estimated to be around 7-16.38 However, these meta-analyses have not shown a statistically significant reduction in CV death or all-cause mortality alone.59 This consistent pattern across trials suggests that while IV iron effectively addresses the consequences of ID contributing to HF decompensation and functional limitation (leading to fewer hospitalizations and better QoL), it may not sufficiently impact the underlying disease progression or other factors driving mortality within the typical follow-up periods of these studies.

Based on the strong evidence for improved symptoms, QoL, functional capacity, and reduced HF hospitalizations, major international HF guidelines (including AHA/ACC/HFSA and ESC) now recommend screening all patients with HF for ID and administering IV iron (specifically FCM often cited due to trial evidence) to symptomatic patients with HFrEF (LVEF â‰¤40%) or HFmrEF (LVEF 41-49%) and documented ID (Class IIa recommendation).39

Iron Overload and Cardiovascular Health
Conditions leading to systemic iron overload, such as hereditary hemochromatosis (excessive iron absorption) or secondary overload due to repeated blood transfusions for chronic anemias (e.g., thalassemia major, sickle cell disease), pose a significant threat to cardiovascular health.7 Excess iron progressively deposits in the myocardium, triggering oxidative stress, inflammation, cellular damage, and fibrosis.7 This leads to a specific iron overload cardiomyopathy characterized initially by diastolic dysfunction, followed by arrhythmias, left ventricular dilation, and ultimately systolic heart failure, which is a major cause of mortality in these patients if untreated.41 Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), particularly T2* sequences, is a crucial non-invasive tool for quantifying myocardial iron deposition and guiding therapy.41

The cornerstone of management for iron overload is iron chelation therapy, aimed at binding excess iron and facilitating its excretion, thereby preventing or reversing organ damage.41 Three main iron chelators are available: deferoxamine (DFO), typically administered via slow subcutaneous or intravenous infusion; deferiprone (DFP), an oral agent known for its good penetration into myocardial cells; and deferasirox (DFX), another oral agent available in different formulations.41 The choice of chelator, dose, and administration schedule depends on the severity of iron overload (particularly cardiac iron levels), the rate of ongoing iron accumulation (e.g., transfusion frequency), patient age, comorbidities, tolerance, and adherence.41 In cases of severe cardiac iron overload or inadequate response to monotherapy, combination therapy using two chelators with different mechanisms or pharmacokinetic profiles (e.g., DFO infusion combined with oral DFP) is often employed to achieve more rapid and effective iron removal.41 Achieving negative iron balance and reducing serum ferritin levels (often targeted below 1000 Î¼g/L, though cardiac iron assessed by MRI is paramount) are key therapeutic goals.41 Crucially, early initiation and consistent adherence to chelation therapy are vital for preventing irreversible cardiac damage and improving long-term survival.41 There is evidence demonstrating that effective chelation therapy can lead to significant improvement, and in some cases, reversal of iron overload cardiomyopathy.42

Chelation Therapy (for Atherosclerotic CVD / Heavy Metals)
The rationale for using chelation therapy, specifically with the synthetic amino acid edetate disodium (EDTA), for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease stems from hypotheses that it might remove calcium from atherosclerotic plaques or, more recently, remove toxic heavy metals like lead and cadmium, which are increasingly recognized as cardiovascular risk factors.17 EDTA is a potent chelator known to bind divalent and trivalent metal ions.

The primary evidence evaluating EDTA chelation for CVD comes from the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT) and its successor, TACT2.

TACT, published in 2013, was a large (n=1708), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT involving patients aged 50 years or older with a history of myocardial infarction.66 Participants received 40 infusions of either an EDTA-based solution (containing disodium EDTA, ascorbate, B vitamins, magnesium, potassium, procaine, and heparin) or a saline placebo over approximately a year, in a 2x2 factorial design that also tested high-dose oral multivitamins versus placebo.66 The trial found a statistically significant, albeit modest, reduction in the primary composite endpoint (all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for angina) over a median follow-up of 55 months (event rate 26.5% in the chelation group vs. 30.0% in the placebo group; Hazard Ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.99, p=0.035).66 This benefit appeared largely driven by a reduction in the need for coronary revascularization, with no significant differences observed in the individual endpoints of death, MI, or stroke.66 A pre-specified subgroup analysis revealed a striking interaction with diabetes status: patients with diabetes (37% of the cohort) experienced a substantial reduction in the primary endpoint with chelation (25% vs. 38%, HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44-0.79, p<0.001), a finding that remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons.68 In contrast, no benefit was observed in patients without diabetes.66 However, TACT faced criticism regarding methodological limitations, including a high participant dropout rate (around one-third did not complete all infusions, and 17% withdrew consent), potential challenges to blinding due to infusion site reactions, and uncertainty about the mechanism of action given the complex multi-component infusion.66
TACT2 was specifically designed to replicate the findings of TACT in the subgroup that showed the most apparent benefit: post-MI patients with type 2 diabetes.71 Conducted between 2016 and 2023, it enrolled 1000 participants (959 received infusions) meeting these criteria and used the same EDTA infusion protocol as TACT.67 Crucially, TACT2 also measured blood lead and urinary cadmium levels to assess the effectiveness of chelation in removing these metals.72 The results, reported in 2024, showed that TACT2 failed to replicate the positive findings of TACT.67 There was no significant difference in the primary composite endpoint between the EDTA chelation group and the placebo group (35.6% vs. 35.7%, HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.16, p=0.53).67 Similarly, no benefits were seen for secondary endpoints, including CV death, MI, stroke, or all-cause mortality.67 TACT2 did confirm, however, that the EDTA infusions were effective at chelating heavy metals, significantly reducing blood lead levels by approximately 61% and markedly increasing urinary cadmium excretion compared to placebo.67
The failure of TACT2 to demonstrate clinical benefit, despite effectively removing lead and cadmium, strongly challenges the hypothesis that heavy metal removal is the primary mechanism underlying the positive results observed in the original TACT, particularly in the diabetic subgroup. This disconnect leaves the TACT findings largely unexplained â€“ potentially attributable to chance, confounding factors (such as unmeasured lifestyle changes sometimes associated with alternative therapies 66), or perhaps other components of the complex infusion mixture used. The lack of replication in a trial specifically designed to confirm the initial promising signal significantly undermines the rationale for using EDTA chelation as a treatment for established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Overall Assessment: Based on the totality of evidence, particularly the negative results of the confirmatory TACT2 trial, EDTA chelation therapy is not considered an effective or recommended treatment for preventing cardiovascular events in patients with established atherosclerotic disease, including those with diabetes and prior MI. Its use for this indication is not supported by major cardiovascular guidelines or regulatory agencies.70 While reducing exposure to environmental heavy metals remains an important public health goal 18, EDTA chelation has not been proven as a beneficial intervention for established CVD.

4. Safety, Feasibility, and Regulatory Landscape
Adverse Effects and Risks of Mineral Supplementation
While often perceived as benign, mineral supplements are not without risks, particularly when taken in excessive doses, by individuals with certain underlying conditions, or in combination with medications.73 The assumption that "natural" equates to safe is unfounded.74

Magnesium: Oral magnesium is generally safe, but high doses commonly cause osmotic diarrhea.28 Intravenous administration requires careful monitoring for hypotension, respiratory depression, and heart block, although these are rare with therapeutic use in HF trials.
Potassium: Oral potassium supplements (usually KCl) are typically well-tolerated by individuals with normal kidney function.35 However, the primary risk is hyperkalemia (elevated serum potassium), which can cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. This risk is significantly increased in patients with chronic kidney disease, those taking potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone), ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), necessitating caution and monitoring in these populations.33 Gastrointestinal upset can also occur.33
Selenium: Selenium has a relatively narrow therapeutic window. Chronic intake exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level can lead to selenosis, characterized by hair loss, nail changes, skin lesions, gastrointestinal disturbances, and neurological symptoms. As noted previously, supplementation, particularly in selenium-replete individuals, may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.48 The SELECT trial also reported increased rates of alopecia and dermatitis.48
Calcium: Common side effects of calcium supplements include constipation and other gastrointestinal complaints.26 The potential for increased cardiovascular risk remains a significant point of controversy (discussed in Section 3.A.iv). High intake, especially without adequate fluid or when taken separately from meals, may increase the risk of kidney stones.25
Iron (Oral): Oral iron supplements are frequently associated with gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. These side effects are a major reason for poor adherence and limited efficacy in repleting iron stores, particularly in sensitive populations like HF patients.7
Iron (IV): Intravenous iron formulations are generally considered safe and well-tolerated in the context of HF trials.38 Potential adverse effects include infusion reactions, which are typically mild but can rarely be severe (anaphylaxis). Transient hypophosphatemia is relatively common but usually asymptomatic. Historical concerns about increased infection risk with IV iron have not been borne out in large clinical trials.59
Adverse Effects, Risks, and Contraindications of Chelation Therapy
Chelation therapy involves the administration of agents designed to bind and remove metals from the body, and carries inherent risks related to electrolyte disturbances and organ toxicity.

EDTA Chelation: The administration of disodium EDTA, particularly the formulation used in TACT/TACT2, carries significant risks. Common side effects include burning or pain at the infusion site, fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting.71 More serious potential complications arise from EDTA's strong affinity for calcium, leading to hypocalcemia, which can cause tetany, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypotension.71 Nephrotoxicity, ranging from transient renal dysfunction to irreversible kidney damage, is a major concern.71 Other reported serious adverse effects include bone marrow depression, heart failure exacerbation, and, rarely, death.70 Due to these safety concerns, careful monitoring of serum calcium, electrolytes, and renal function during therapy is essential. EDTA chelation is generally contraindicated in patients with significant renal impairment.75 Concerns over its safety profile contributed to the FDA withdrawing approval for some of its historical indications.70
Iron Chelators (DFO, DFP, DFX): Each of the approved iron chelators has a distinct safety profile requiring specific monitoring.41 Deferoxamine (DFO) can cause local infusion site reactions, as well as auditory (hearing loss) and ophthalmologic (retinal toxicity) side effects, particularly with high doses or in patients with low iron burden; growth impairment in children was also a concern.65 Deferiprone (DFP) carries a risk of potentially fatal agranulocytosis (severe neutropenia), necessitating regular monitoring of absolute neutrophil counts (black box warning) 41; arthralgia and gastrointestinal upset are also common.41 Deferasirox (DFX) has black box warnings for potentially serious or fatal renal toxicity, hepatic toxicity, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.41
Regulatory Status (FDA/EMA)
The regulatory landscape differs significantly between dietary supplements and prescription medications, impacting the level of scrutiny regarding safety, efficacy, and quality control.

Dietary Supplements (Mg, K, Se, Ca, Oral Fe): In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the FDA under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA). They are considered a category of food, not drugs.76 Crucially, the FDA does not approve dietary supplements or their labeling before they go to market.76 The responsibility for ensuring safety and proper labeling lies with the manufacturer.73 The FDA's role is primarily post-market surveillance; it can take action against products found to be unsafe, adulterated, or making false or misleading claims, but only after they are already available to consumers.73 This regulatory framework means there is no guarantee of product quality, consistency, potency, or purity; testing has revealed instances where supplements contain little or none of the listed ingredient, incorrect doses, or even harmful contaminants.73 Furthermore, supplements cannot legally claim to treat, diagnose, cure, or prevent diseases.76 The potential for interactions between supplements and prescription or over-the-counter medications is significant and potentially dangerous.73 This lack of rigorous pre-market review and potential variability in product quality represents a fundamental challenge when evaluating the evidence base for supplement interventions, as the findings from one study using a specific preparation may not be generalizable.
Prescription Drugs (IV Iron, Approved Chelators): Intravenous iron formulations and approved chelating agents (DFO, DFP, DFX, EDTA for specific poisonings) are regulated as prescription drugs. This requires manufacturers to conduct extensive pre-clinical and clinical trials to demonstrate both safety and efficacy for specific indications before gaining marketing approval from regulatory agencies like the FDA or the European Medicines Agency (EMA).70 Manufacturing processes are subject to stringent quality control standards (Good Manufacturing Practices). This rigorous process provides a higher degree of confidence in the quality, consistency, and evidence base for approved pharmaceuticals compared to dietary supplements.
Chelation Therapy (EDTA for CVD): EDTA chelation therapy is not approved by the FDA for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disease.71 The FDA has issued warnings advising consumers against using over-the-counter chelation products (marketed as supplements, nasal sprays, suppositories, etc.), emphasizing that these products are unapproved, potentially harmful, and should not be used in place of conventional medical care.70 FDA-approved chelating agents are available only by prescription for specific, approved indications like heavy metal poisoning or iron overload.70
The significant risks associated with chelation therapy, particularly EDTA, must be weighed against the evidence of benefit. For iron overload, the potentially life-saving benefits of chelation clearly justify the risks when managed appropriately.41 However, for the indication of atherosclerotic CVD, the failure of TACT2 to demonstrate efficacy means that the known and potentially serious risks of EDTA chelation (hypocalcemia, nephrotoxicity) 71 are not balanced by proven clinical benefit. This unfavorable risk-benefit profile strongly argues against its use for CVD outside of rigorously controlled clinical trials and supports the positions of regulatory agencies and major medical societies.70

5. Synthesis, Consensus, and Future Directions
Integration of Evidence
The exploration of modulating metal ion concentrations for cardiovascular health reveals a spectrum of evidence, ranging from established therapeutic roles to areas of significant controversy and strategies lacking scientific support.

Established Benefits: The most compelling evidence supports the use of intravenous iron supplementation in symptomatic patients with heart failure (HFrEF and likely HFmrEF) and documented iron deficiency. Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses consistently show improvements in symptoms, quality of life, exercise capacity, and a reduction in heart failure hospitalizations.38 Similarly, increasing potassium intake, either through diet (e.g., DASH) or supplements, is a well-established, evidence-based strategy for lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of stroke, particularly in hypertensive individuals.33 Lastly, iron chelation therapy is the standard of care for managing iron overload conditions like hereditary hemochromatosis and transfusion-dependent anemias, preventing or mitigating severe cardiac complications.41
Areas of Uncertainty/Controversy: The role of magnesium supplementation in primary CVD prevention remains uncertain. While biologically plausible mechanisms exist, and benefits are seen for specific conditions like post-ACS arrhythmias and potentially for metabolic improvements in deficient individuals, robust evidence for preventing major CVD events is lacking.28 Selenium supplementation for primary CVD prevention is not supported by current RCT evidence, especially in well-nourished populations, and potential risks related to type 2 diabetes warrant caution.48 The cardiovascular safety of calcium supplements continues to be debated, with conflicting meta-analyses and plausible mechanisms for potential harm, contrasting with the apparent safety of dietary calcium.26 The lack of a demonstrated mortality benefit despite reduced hospitalizations with IV iron in HF requires further investigation to understand its full impact on disease trajectory.60 The clinical significance and optimal management strategies for zinc and copper imbalances in specific CVD settings are less clearly defined compared to iron or magnesium.
Disproven/Unsupported: Based on the failure of the TACT2 trial to replicate the findings of TACT, EDTA chelation therapy is considered ineffective for reducing cardiovascular events in patients with established atherosclerotic disease, including the diabetic post-MI subgroup.67 Oral iron supplementation has been shown to be ineffective for improving functional status or iron indices in HFrEF patients with ID.38
Current Guideline Recommendations
Major clinical practice guidelines from organizations like the American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC), European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) reflect the current state of evidence, incorporating interventions only when supported by sufficiently robust data, typically from large RCTs demonstrating clinical benefit.

General CVD prevention guidelines continue to focus primarily on managing established risk factors such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and promoting healthy lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise).77 They do not typically include specific recommendations for routine mineral supplementation (Mg, Se, Ca) for primary prevention.
Dietary guidelines, such as those promoting the DASH diet, implicitly endorse adequate intake of minerals like potassium and magnesium through food choices.33 Recommendations for calcium intake prioritize dietary sources for bone health.25
Heart failure guidelines explicitly recommend screening for iron deficiency in all HF patients and treating symptomatic HFrEF/HFmrEF patients with documented ID using intravenous iron (Class IIa recommendation) to improve symptoms, functional capacity, quality of life, and reduce HF hospitalizations.39
Chelation therapy with EDTA for atherosclerotic CVD is not recommended by any major cardiovascular society guidelines due to lack of proven efficacy and potential safety concerns.70
The AHA has recognized contaminant metals (lead, cadmium, arsenic) as significant cardiovascular risk factors, advocating for public health measures to reduce exposure, although specific clinical interventions like chelation for this purpose lack definitive supporting trial evidence beyond TACT2's negative findings for EDTA.18
The pattern of guideline recommendations highlights a high threshold for adoption, generally requiring strong evidence from RCTs showing improvement in clinical outcomes or major risk factors. IV iron in HFrEF/ID and potassium-rich diets meet this threshold for specific benefits (HF hospitalizations/QoL and BP/stroke, respectively). The absence of recommendations for routine Mg, Se, or supplemental Ca for CVD prevention reflects the lack of consistent, high-quality evidence for reducing major cardiovascular events, while the negative results for EDTA chelation preclude its endorsement.

Concluding Remarks
Modulating metal ion concentrations offers a range of biologically plausible approaches to influencing cardiovascular health. However, the clinical translation of these concepts is complex, with efficacy varying significantly depending on the specific metal, the intervention strategy, and the patient population. Intravenous iron repletion for patients with HFrEF/HFmrEF and iron deficiency, along with optimizing dietary potassium intake for blood pressure control and stroke prevention, represent the most clearly evidence-based interventions in this field currently endorsed by guidelines.

Conversely, routine supplementation with magnesium or selenium for general cardiovascular prevention in unselected populations lacks robust support from clinical trials. Calcium supplementation should be approached with caution due to ongoing cardiovascular safety concerns, prioritizing dietary sources to meet bone health needs. EDTA chelation therapy has been demonstrated to be ineffective for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and carries significant risks, making it an inappropriate treatment for this indication. Finally, minimizing exposure to toxic environmental contaminant metals like lead, cadmium, and arsenic remains an important, though often overlooked, aspect of cardiovascular disease prevention from a public health perspective.

Knowledge Gaps and Future Research
Despite progress, significant knowledge gaps remain, necessitating further research:

Iron Metabolism: Refining diagnostic criteria for functional iron deficiency in the inflammatory milieu of HF remains crucial for optimizing patient selection for IV iron therapy.7 Adequately powered RCTs are needed to definitively determine whether IV iron provides a mortality benefit in HFrEF and to evaluate its efficacy and safety in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
Magnesium: Large-scale RCTs with hard cardiovascular endpoints are required to clarify whether magnesium supplementation offers clinically meaningful benefits beyond specific niches like arrhythmias, particularly targeting populations with documented deficiency or high baseline risk.
Calcium: Further research, potentially utilizing novel study designs and assessing vascular calcification markers, is needed to resolve the controversy surrounding the cardiovascular safety of calcium supplements versus dietary calcium. Understanding the long-term implications of acute physiological changes induced by supplements is important.
Chelation Therapy: Elucidating the reasons for the discrepancy between TACT and TACT2 results could provide valuable insights into trial design or patient heterogeneity, though further trials of EDTA for CVD seem unwarranted.72
Other Metals: The potential roles for modulating zinc and copper status in specific cardiovascular contexts (e.g., post-MI, specific cardiomyopathies) warrant further investigation.
Contaminant Metals: Given the established link between Pb, Cd, and As exposure and CVD risk 18, and the failure of EDTA in TACT2, research should focus on identifying populations at highest risk, improving exposure assessment, and exploring alternative, safe, and effective strategies (potentially including more targeted chelation agents or nutritional interventions) to mitigate the cardiovascular burden associated with these environmental toxins.
