Saint Seiya Armors and Warriors by Class
The Saint Seiya franchise features a rich hierarchy of warriors distinguished by their armors. Each class of armor – Cloths (Bronze, Silver, Gold Saints), Scales (Marina Generals), Surplices (Hades’ Specters), God Robes (Asgard’s God Warriors), and others – comes with its own notable characters, power levels, techniques, and story arcs. Below is a comprehensive analysis organized by armor class, with key characters and details for each.

Bronze Saints (Bronze Cloths)
Bronze Saints are the lowest-ranked Saints of Athena’s 88 warriors, initially far weaker than Silver or Gold Saints. Their Bronze Cloths offer basic protection and their Cosmo mastery is limited ([Bronze Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_Saints#:~:text=Bronze Saints wear the Bronze,the power of Gold saints)). Early on, a typical Bronze Saint can move at Mach 1 speed and throw 100 punches per second – impressive for a human, but only a fraction of a Gold Saint’s power ([Bronze Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_Saints#:~:text=Bronze

Pegasus Seiya (Pegasus Bronze Saint)
Pegasus Seiya is the protagonist of Saint Seiya, bearing the Pegasus Cloth. Power Level: Initially one of the weaker Saints, Seiya’s Cosmo grows exponentially through battle. Under mentor Marin’s training, he awakens the Seventh Sense, the essence of Cosmo that only the strongest Saints wield ([Pegasus Seiya | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Seiya#:~:text=,the spirit realm%2C enabling resurrection)). By the time he fights Gold Saint Taurus Aldebaran, Seiya is able to burn his Cosmo to a level equal to a Gold Saint’s, matching Aldebaran’s power ([Pegasus Seiya | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Seiya#:~:text=power

Dragon Shiryū (Dragon Bronze Saint)
Dragon Shiryū is the Bronze Saint of Dragon, known for his honor and discipline. Power Level: Among the Bronze Saints, Shiryū is often cited as the most mature and is a master of combat philosophy learned from Libra Dohko ([Dragon Shiryū - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Shiryū#:~:text=Out of the five main,the old master's protégé Chunli)). His Dragon Cloth boasts the strongest shield and fist (the Dragon Shield and Right Fist) among Bronze armors ([Dragon Shiryū - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Shiry

Cygnus Hyōga (Cygnus Bronze Saint)
Cygnus Hyōga is the Bronze Saint of Cygnus (Swan), a master of ice techniques. Power Level: Hyōga is trained by Aquarius Camus (or the Crystal Saint in the anime) and learns to wield absolute zero ice attacks. He gradually awakens the Seventh Sense in combat against his mentor. By the Poseidon and Hades arcs, Hyōga’s Cosmo is on par with Gold Saints – he can freeze Gold Cloths and even gods’ surplices with Athena’s blood. Techniques: Hyōga’s trademark move is Diamond Dust, a burst of icy wind that can instantly freeze opponents ([Lyra Orphée (Character) - Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/orphee-saint-of-lyra/4005-49907/#:~:text=Lyra Orphée (Character) ,his skill with the lyre)). He also uses Aurora Thunder Attack (a stronger freezing punch) and Aurora Execution, the ultimate ice blast inherited from Camus. Hyōga’s attacks reach temperatures near absolute zero, granting him deadly effectiveness – for instance, his Koliso technique encases foes in unbreakable ice coffins. Key Story Arcs: Hyōga’s journey is marked by personal trials – in the Sanctuary arc he is forced to fight his mentor Camus in the House of Aquarius. In an emotional duel, Hyōga pushes his Cosmo to absolute zero, matching Camus’s Aurora Execution; both nearly perish, but Hyōga survives, proving his mastery of the Seventh Sense. Earlier, Hyōga defeated Silver Saint Kraken Isaac (his childhood friend) in Poseidon’s Undersea Temple, showing mercy in the end. During the Poseidon arc, Hyōga destroys the Arctic Ocean pillar after overcoming Isaac. In the Hades arc, Hyōga attains the Eighth Sense to enter Hell. He battles specters alongside Shiryū – together they shatter Griffon Minos’s deadly Cosmic Marionettion attack. Hyōga is also the one to finally freeze Celestial Fierce Star Rhadamanthys’s surplice at Cocytus, avenging Camus. Final Outcome: Hyōga survives through the Hades War. At the end, he bids farewell to his mother’s undersea grave, indicating he’ll live freely. In later continuities, Hyōga travels (as seen in Next Dimension) or mentors others – in Saint Seiya Omega, an adult Hyōga is a wanderer and eventually is implied to become the new Aquarius Gold Saint.

Andromeda Shun (Andromeda Bronze Saint)
Andromeda Shun is the Bronze Saint of Andromeda, characterized by his gentle nature and immense Cosmo potential. Power Level: Shun is often said to harbor the greatest Cosmo among the Bronze Five when enraged, though he dislikes violence. His Cosmo energy – represented by the Nebula – can rise to unimaginable levels. Shun awakens the Seventh Sense during the 12 Temples battle and later even hosts the soul of Hades due to the purity of his body. By the Elysion fights, Shun dons the Andromeda God Cloth, indicating a power on par with divine beings. Techniques: Shun wields the Andromeda Nebula Chain, a versatile weapon for offense and defense. He can use the chain in various modes: Thunder Wave (offensive strikes), Rolling Defense (a protective circle of chains), and Wild Trap (snaring the enemy). His ultimate attack is Nebula Storm, unleashed only under extreme emotional drive – it summons the full fury of the Andromeda Nebula to annihilate an opponent. In his pacifism, Shun holds Nebula Storm in reserve, but when used, it easily defeated powerful foes (like Sea Dragon Kanon’s illusions). Key Story Arcs: Throughout the Sanctuary arc, Shun’s kindness is tested: he defeats tough opponents like Black Saints and Silver Saints (e.g., he mercifully vanquishes Silver Saint Albiore’s killer). In the 12 Temples, Shun’s crucial moment is against Pisces Aphrodite – Shun awakens his Nebula Storm to avenge his fallen friends, killing Aphrodite at the cost of severe injuries. During the Poseidon arc, Shun faces Scylla Io. Using strategy and his six sense, Shun’s chain neutralizes Io’s beastly attacks one by one; he then unleashes Nebula Storm to win. In the Hades arc, Shun becomes central: his body is chosen as Hades’ vessel due to Shun’s “undefiled” pure spirit. Shun nearly succumbs to Hades, but his brother Ikki intervenes, allowing Athena to expel Hades from Shun. After regaining himself, Shun joins the final battle in Elysion wearing his evolved God Cloth and helps Seiya strike down Hades. Final Outcome: Shun survives the war and returns to normal life, still gentle and pacifist. In Next Dimension, Shun travels back to the 18th century with Athena to save Seiya, meeting the previous Andromeda Saint. In Saint Seiya Omega, an older Shun has relinquished fighting (his Cosmo is sealed by a past event), but he continues to aid the new generation as a doctor/healer. Shun’s final fate is to live in peace, having overcome the curse of Hades and saved his friends.

Phoenix Ikki (Phoenix Bronze Saint)
Phoenix Ikki is the Bronze Saint of Phoenix, the lone wolf and eldest of the Bronze Five. Power Level: Ikki is the most naturally powerful Bronze Saint early on – he defeats all the other Bronze Saints in the Galaxian Wars tournament initially. Ikki’s Cosmo is exceptionally aggressive and he grows stronger after every “death,” true to the immortal Phoenix. He awakens the Seventh Sense during his battles with Virgo Shaka, and by the Hades arc he is comfortably fighting on par with Gold Saints and even the underworld’s Judges. Ikki is known for repeatedly doing the impossible: he crushed one of Hades’s top judges (Garuda Aiacos) in a one-on-one fight ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Leo Aiolia%2C Aries Mu%2C and,and buried him in Cocytus)) and even resisted Hades’s soul manipulation. Techniques: Ikki’s most fearsome technique is the Hoō Genma Ken (Phoenix Illusion Demon Fist), a psychic attack that infiltrates the opponent’s mind and drives them insane or forces them to see horrifying illusions. With this, Ikki famously incapacitated Virgo Shaka (by self-destructing in Shaka’s mind) and later broke Sea Dragon Kanon’s will. Ikki also employs the Phoenix Ken or Hō-ō Tenshō, a powerful blow often depicted as a fiery phoenix emanation that burns the enemy. His defining trait, however, is resurrection – the Phoenix Cloth and Ikki himself regenerate from any defeat, becoming stronger each time. Key Story Arcs: Introduced initially as an antagonist, Ikki steals the Gold Cloth in the Galaxian Wars and fights his former Bronze peers. He is redeemed after Seiya’s group defeats him and the influence of evil is lifted from his heart. Ikki then becomes the Bronze Saints’ greatest trump card, often arriving at critical moments. In the Sanctuary arc, Ikki intervenes to fight Virgo Shaka – their confrontation is legendary. Outmatched by Shaka’s godlike power, Ikki withstands Shaka’s Tenbu Hōrin (which removes senses) longer than anyone, ultimately choosing to sacrifice himself in a massive explosion to try to take Shaka down. Though Ikki dies, his Phoenix Cloth restores him shortly after. Ikki also destroys Virgo Shaka’s demon rosary in that battle, earning Shaka’s respect. During the Poseidon arc, Ikki faces Sea Dragon Kanon. Using the Phoenix Illusion Fist, he breaks Kanon’s facade and reveals his identity as Saga’s twin. Ikki nearly kills Kanon, but Athena’s mercy convinces him to spare the repentant Kanon. In the Hades arc, Ikki is a one-man army: he defeats numerous Specters, including brutally executing Garuda Aiacos (one of Hades’s three Judges) with his Hoyoku Tenshō ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Leo

Other Notable Bronze Saints: Beyond the main five, there are dozens of Bronze Saints (48 in total ([Bronze Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_Saints#:~:text=There are 48 Bronze Saints%2C,number among the 88 Saints))), though most are minor. In the 20th century, notable ones include Unicorn Jabu, Wolf Nachi, Bear Geki, Hydra Ichi, and Lionet Ban – contestants in the Galaxian Wars. They assist during the Sanctuary battles (evacuating Saori, etc.) but play secondary roles. In the 18th century (Lost Canvas era), Pegasus Tenma is the Bronze Saint equivalent of Seiya and a major character (detailed below). His friend Unicorn Yato and Crane Yuzuriha (a female saint, Crane cloth) are notable Bronze/Silver Saints aiding Athena in that era ([Bronze Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_Saints#:~:text=Although Bronze Saints usually have,Tenma from 75)). In the 21st century (Saint Seiya Omega timeline), a new generation of Bronze Saints arises, including Pegasus Kōga (Seiya’s successor) and his comrades Lionet Sōma, Wolf Haruto, Aquila Yuna, Dragon Ryūhō (Shiryū’s son), and Orion Eden. They learn to harness elemental Cosmo and eventually attain the forbidden Omega state (a Cosmo beyond the 7th sense) to defeat the gods Abzu and Saturn. These Bronze Saints continue the legacy, but their stories occur in an alternate continuity.

Pegasus Tenma (18th Century Pegasus Saint – The Lost Canvas)
Pegasus Tenma is the Pegasus Bronze Saint of the 18th-century Holy War, featured in Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas. He is the previous incarnation of Pegasus Seiya ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=of myth%2C reincarnated in this,of the Magnates from the)). Power Level: Tenma follows a trajectory similar to Seiya’s – starting modestly but eventually awakening the Seventh Sense and even the Eighth Sense (Arayashiki) in the fight against Hades. By the war’s climax, Tenma’s Cosmo is strong enough to harm Hades’s host Alone, a feat feared by Hades across eras ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=Next Dimension resumes the story,a boy named Alone%2C Hades)). Techniques: Tenma uses Pegasus Ryūsei Ken (Meteor Fist) and Pegasus Suisei Ken (Comet Fist) just like Seiya, unleashing volleys of punches or a single powerful blow. Under Dohko and Sisyphos’s guidance, Tenma greatly refines his Cosmo and develops the divine Pegasus techniques. Key Story Arcs: As one of Athena Sasha’s 88 Saints in the 18th century, Tenma’s main journey is told in The Lost Canvas. He grows up alongside Alone (the future Hades vessel) and Sasha (Athena’s reincarnation). When Hades awakens in Alone, Tenma vows to save his friend. He becomes a Pegasus Saint and fights the Specters through the Holy War. Tenma forms close bonds with Gold Saints like Libra Dohko and Aries Shion (his mentors). Over the course of battles, Tenma’s Cosmo repeatedly “miraculously” surges – for instance, he attains the 8th Sense in the underworld, guided by Virgo Asmita’s sacrifice, allowing him to fight Hades on even footing. Final Outcome: In the Lost Canvas climax, Tenma, together with Athena Sasha and Alone’s remaining humanity, manages to seal Hades. This victory comes at great cost. It is implied that Tenma sacrifices himself or at least disappears along with Hades’s soul at the end of the war (in line with the known myth that Pegasus Tenma’s life ended in that Holy War). The two sole surviving Saints of that era are Aries Shion and Libra Dohko ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=and himself 243 years earlier,Hades from completing his machinations)), who live on to the 20th century. Tenma’s legacy is one of heroism: he wounded Hades badly enough in the 18th century that Hades remembers and fears Pegasus in the next reincarnation ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=Next

Equuleus Shōko (Equuleus Saintia – Saintia Shō)
Equuleus Shōko is the protagonist of Saintia Shō, a special class of female Saints known as Saintias (Athena’s handmaidens). She wears the Equuleus (Little Horse) Bronze Cloth ([Equuleus Shōko | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Equuleus_Shōko#:~:text=That night%2C Shōko is the,received to become a Saint)). Power Level: As a Saintia, Shōko starts as an apprentice but shows strong resolve and Cosmo. She trains under the Silver Saint Pavo Mayura, rapidly growing in strength to fight deity-class enemies. By the climax, Shōko’s Cosmo resonates with her sister’s and Athena’s, enabling her to momentarily rival the goddess Eris. Techniques: Shōko inherits the fighting style of Equuleus. She has no named special attack at first, but after training, she can unleash powerful Cosmo blows and use the small horse constellation’s agility in combat. (Her moves are less documented than the main Bronze Saints, but she eventually awakens her own Seventh Sense during her final battle with Eris’s champion). Key Story Arcs: Shōko’s story runs parallel to the Sanctuary arc. Her elder sister Kyōko was originally the Equuleus Saintia. When the evil goddess Eris attempts to manifest, she targets Shōko as a host. Kyōko sacrifices herself to save Shōko, becoming possessed by Eris instead ([Equuleus Shōko | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Equuleus_Sh

Silver Saints (Silver Cloths)
Silver Saints are mid-tier Saints of Athena, stronger and higher-ranked than Bronze Saints but below Gold Saints. They wear Silver Cloths, which represent constellations of medium brightness. Silver Saints can move at least at several times the speed of sound and have mastered more advanced Cosmo techniques than Bronze Saints ([Eagle Marin | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Marin#:~:text=The Eagle Cloth is the,second rank of the Cloths)). In the original series, Silver Saints are often antagonists early on (sent by the false Pope to kill the Bronze Saints) and later become allies or mentors. Many Silver Saints possess unique, deadly techniques – however, in the power hierarchy, even the strongest Silver Saints are markedly weaker than Gold Saints ([Saitama (One Punch Man) vs Eagle Marin and Ophiuchus Shaina ...](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/saitama-one-punch-man-vs-eagle-marin-and-ophiuchus-shaina-saint-seiya.688555/#:~:text=,continent level%2C at bare minimum)). A few exceptional Silvers approach Gold level in Cosmo. Key Silver Saints include:

Aquila Marin (Eagle Marin)
Eagle Marin is a Silver Saint and the mentor of Pegasus Seiya. Power Level: Marin is an experienced Saint whose power as a Silver far exceeded Seiya’s when he was training. She easily defeated lesser Bronze Saints and could battle other Silvers evenly. Marin’s true strength is hinted when she survives against forces like Poseidon’s Marines and Hades’s Specters while protecting Seiya. Techniques: Marin’s signature move is the Eagle Ryūsei Ken (Meteor Punch) ([Eagle Marin | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Marin#:~:text=creation of illusions,Lizard Misty from killing him)) – she barrages the enemy with hundreds of punches per second, similar to the Pegasus Meteor Fist (in fact, she taught that technique to Seiya; as an Eagle Saint, her version is simply not called “Pegasus” Meteor Fist) ([Eagle Marin | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Marin#:~:text=creation

Ophiuchus Shaina (Serpent Bearer Shaina)
Ophiuchus Shaina is a Silver Saint who initially opposes Seiya but later becomes a fierce ally. Power Level: As a Silver Saint, Shaina is considerably strong – “far superior to those of Bronze Saints” ([Ophiuchus Shaina (Character) - Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ophiuchus-shaina/4005-45451/#:~:text=As a Silver Saint%2C Shaina,those of Bronze Saints%2C)). She can overpower untrained Bronze fighters easily and even Bronze Saints if they’re not at full strength. Though she cannot match a Gold Saint, Shaina’s determination and skill make her a threat to high-level foes when given an opening. Techniques: Shaina’s signature move is Thunder Claw (Sandā Kurō) – she swipes her hands in a cobra-like motion, releasing a powerful shockwave of Cosmo ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=Thunder Claw ,and by the sharp claws)). This technique delivers an electric shock and slashes the target with her sharp clawed gauntlets ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=Thunder

Lyra Orpheus (Lyra Orphée)
Lyra Orpheus (Orphée) is an extraordinary Silver Saint, known as the legendary saint-musician. (Note: Orpheus appears in the Hades arc, mainly in the anime Hades Chapter OVA and the manga as Lyra Orphée.) Power Level: Orpheus is no ordinary Silver Saint – his Cosmo “was so great that it gained the reputation of being above the level of Gold Saints” ([Lyra Orphée | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Lyra_Orphée#:~:text=Lyra Orphée was not only,the love of his life)). Even fellow Saints knew of Lyra’s fame; Seiya had heard that Orpheus’s power surpassed Gold Saints ([Lyra Orphée | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Lyra_Orph

(Other Silver Saints:) There are many other Silver Saints in Saint Seiya, mostly appearing as adversaries in the early arcs. A few notable ones include Perseus Algol (wielded the Medusa Shield that turned opponents to stone – defeated by Shiryū’s self-blinding tactic (Sense | Seiyapedia | Fandom)), Sagitta Ptolemy (the Silver Archer who struck Saori with a golden arrow, triggering the 12 Temples quest), Ophiuchus Misty (a narcissistic Saint whom Seiya defeated), Crateris Suikyō (introduced in Next Dimension as a former Silver Saint who became a Specter – Garuda), and Natassia (Crystal Saint) in the anime (Hyōga’s mentor, anime-only). Generally, Silver Saints serve as stepping stones to test the Bronze Saints’ growth. By the end of the series, most Silver Saints who opposed Athena are dead, and the loyal ones (Marin, Shaina, and a few others) remain to protect Sanctuary.

Gold Saints (Gold Cloths)
The Gold Saints are the elite warriors of Athena, each guarding one of the Twelve Zodiac Temples. They wear the twelve Gold Cloths, representing the Zodiac constellations Aries through Pisces ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=Image%3A Gold Saints Anime)). Gold Saints are the most powerful Athena’s Saints – their mastery of Cosmo includes the full command of the Seventh Sense, allowing them to move at the speed of light and unleash “miraculous” powers ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=upcoming crisis)) ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=The Gold Saints are among,Arayashiki)). Their Gold Cloths are the most durable and imbued with the light of the Sun, making them nearly indestructible by lesser attacks ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=Gold Saints wear Gold Cloths,and light of the sun)). It’s said that when two Gold Saints fight seriously, they could battle for 1,000 days without conclusion (a “Thousand-Day War”) ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=When two Gold Saints with,can both die or fight)), and when three Gold Saints unite their Cosmo, they can perform the forbidden Athena Exclamation, generating a small Big Bang in terms of energy ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=When

Aries Mū (Aries Gold Saint)
Aries Mū is the Gold Saint of Aries and a master of telekinesis and psychokinesis. Power Level: Mu is a very powerful Gold Saint, though soft-spoken. He is one of the few beings who can repair Cloths. While he avoids needless battle, Mu’s Cosmo is formidable – he defeated two Gold Saint Specters (Deathmask and Aphrodite) effortlessly in Hades Chapter ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)) ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Leo Aiolia%2C Aries Mu%2C and,and buried him in Cocytus)). Among Gold Saints of his generation, Mu is considered in the upper tier due to his inherited techniques from his mentor Aries Shion (the former Pope). Techniques: Mu’s signature moves revolve around psychokinetic force. Crystal Wall creates an impenetrable energy shield that blocks most attacks. Starlight Extinction is an attack/teleportation technique – Mu sends enemies into another dimension or erases them in a flash of light. He also uses Stardust Revolution, launching a storm of lights (stellar energy) that bombard the opponent. Additionally, Mu can teleport and use telepathy; he often restrains foes without touching them. Key Story Arcs: In the Sanctuary arc, Mu first appears at Jamir, helping repair the Bronze Saints’ Cloths. He tests Seiya’s resolve by having his apprentice Kiki challenge them. Mu doesn’t fight in the 12 Temples; instead, he greets the Bronze Saints at Aries temple, heals them, and guides them onward. Later, during the Hades arc, Mu plays a crucial role: he battles the resurrected Gold Saints (Saga, Shura, Camus) to defend Athena. Although Mu is forced to retreat after a tough fight (against three together), he kills two renegade Gold Saints (Cancer Deathmask and Pisces Aphrodite) who threatened him, using his telekinetic Starlight Extinction ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys

Taurus Aldebaran (Taurus Gold Saint)
Taurus Aldebaran is the Gold Saint of Taurus, famed for his hulking strength. Power Level: Aldebaran possesses immense physical power and durable defenses. As a Gold Saint he is extremely fast (lightspeed reflexes) despite his size, though among the 12 he is often portrayed as a straightforward brawler rather than a Cosmo technician. In the Sanctuary arc, Seiya – after awakening Seventh Sense – was able to contend with Aldebaran by exploiting his straightforward fighting style ([Pegasus Seiya | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Seiya#:~:text=Seiya%2C a Bronze Saint%2C is,likes of which rarely ever)). However, Aldebaran’s single named attack can level opponents in one blow, and he easily handled Bronze Saints until they surpassed their limits. Techniques: Aldebaran’s trademark move is Great Horn, a devastating double-arm thrust or chop. When executing Great Horn, Aldebaran channels his Cosmo into his arms and strikes with the force of a charging bull, often accompanied by the image of a golden bull’s horns. This attack can smash through walls and send opponents flying; it nearly killed Seiya (Seiya only survived by awakening his Seventh Sense to break one of Aldebaran’s horns and impress him) ([Pegasus Seiya | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Seiya#:~:text=Seiya%2C

Gemini Saga (Gemini Gold Saint)
Gemini Saga is the Gold Saint of Gemini, and was Pope of Sanctuary (as Arles) before his fall to evil. Power Level: Saga is often cited as “the most powerful Saint to have ever served Athena” ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=Canonically%2C Saga is the strongest,they’re been alive for longer)). Canonically, among his generation of Gold Saints, Saga’s power was the highest ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=Canonically%2C

Gemini Kanon (Gemini Gold Saint; formerly Sea Dragon)
Gemini Kanon is Saga’s twin brother. Though not a Gold Saint during most of the original series, Kanon’s journey takes him from villain to hero, and he inherits the Gemini Gold Cloth in the Hades arc. Power Level: Kanon’s Cosmo is equal to Saga’s – as twins, they shared nearly identical potential ([Sea Dragon Kanon | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Dragon_Kanon#:~:text=At first%2C Kanon was depicted,much like his deceased brother)). Kanon’s power was initially misused (he embraced evil and awakened Poseidon), but upon redemption he fights valiantly as a Gold Saint. By the Hades War, Kanon’s strength rivals any Gold Saint; in fact, by then “Kanon is way stronger than Saga” due to additional years of combat experience ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=between canon and “realism”,Kanon didn’t get stronger during)). Like Saga, Kanon can use Galaxian Explosion and other Gemini tricks. Techniques: As Sea Dragon Kanon (one of Poseidon’s Marina Generals), he developed the Golden Triangle – an attack creating a Bermuda Triangle vortex that banishes opponents to another dimension ([Respect Sea Dragon/Gemini Kanon (Saint Seiya: Manga Canon)](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/kw0k7f/respect_sea_dragongemini_kanon_saint_seiya_manga/#:~:text=Respect Sea Dragon%2FGemini Kanon ,his enemy there for eternity)). Kanon trapped enemies in this triangle (he nearly caught Phoenix Ikki with it). After donning the Gemini Cloth, Kanon uses all of Gemini Saga’s techniques: Galaxian Explosion, Another Dimension, and likely Genrōmaōken (though he’s not shown using the Demon Emperor Fist in canon). Kanon also has Poseidon’s relic, the Golden Dagger, which he initially used to manipulate events. Key Story Arcs: In his youth, Kanon’s ambition and malice led Saga to imprison him. Locked in Cape Sounion’s prison, Kanon discovered Poseidon’s sealed trident and intentionally released Poseidon ([Sea Dragon Kanon | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Dragon_Kanon#:~:text=Kanon was the one person,honor of a Gold Saint)). Kanon became Sea Dragon, the de facto leader of Poseidon’s Marinas, all while Poseidon’s soul partially slept. In the Poseidon arc, Kanon (as Sea Dragon) orchestrates the entire war from the shadows. He sends the other Generals to fight Bronze Saints. Eventually, Ikki confronts Sea Dragon. Ikki’s Phoenix Illusion reveals Kanon’s identity and evil deeds. After a fierce fight, Ikki spares Kanon upon realizing Athena’s justice (Athena later personally forgives Kanon). Deeply moved by Athena’s mercy, Kanon has a change of heart ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=out of action,the Seas is sealed again)). He aids in sealing Poseidon and saves Athena. In the Hades arc, Kanon seeks to atone. He is recognized by Athena and given the Gemini Gold Cloth that once belonged to Saga. As the new Gemini Gold Saint, Kanon stands against Hades’s forces at Sanctuary. He plays a pivotal role in defeating Rhadamanthys: infiltrating Hades’s castle, Kanon lures specters to their doom and faces Wyvern Rhadamanthys in Cocytus. Kanon kills multiple specters (like Sylphid, Queen, Gordon) with Galaxian Explosions. Against Rhadamanthys, Kanon fights one-on-one; though gravely wounded by Rhadamanthys’s Greatest Caution, Kanon triumphs by grabbing Rhadamanthys and unleashing a point-blank Galaxian Explosion that kills them both ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=During his first run,Explosion to destroy them both)) ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Cloth left him to aid,Explosion to destroy them both)). Final Outcome: Kanon’s self-sacrifice in Hell redeems him fully. He dies with a smile, knowing he upheld Athena’s honor as a Gold Saint. After death, Kanon’s soul presumably reunites in peace (in Next Dimension there are hints of Saga and Kanon’s spirits guarding Athena). Kanon’s legacy includes inspiring trust even from those who hated him (Phoenix Ikki acknowledges Kanon’s redemption by the end). Kanon’s life illustrates a dramatic redemption arc – from causing a Holy War to becoming one of its greatest heroes.

Cancer Deathmask (Cancer Gold Saint)
Cancer Deathmask is the Gold Saint of Cancer, infamous for his cruelty. Power Level: As a Gold Saint, Deathmask easily dispatches Bronze Saints (he nearly killed Shiryū early on). His Cosmo techniques revolve around souls and the Underworld, making him especially deadly to those with weak spirits. However, among Gold Saints, Deathmask’s fighting prowess is shown to be average; he was outmatched by opponents of strong will (Shiryū with seventh sense defeated him). Techniques: Deathmask’s signature ability is Sekishiki Meikai-ha (Waves of Hades). With a gesture, he can drag the souls of his enemies to Yomotsu Hirasaka, the border between life and death ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Hades led him to question,the force of a typhoon)). This technique effectively banishes opponents to the entrance of the Underworld. Deathmask also is adept at melee combat and uses Sekishiki Kisōen, an attack that unleashes screaming souls as energy blasts. His Cancer Gold Cloth carries images of the faces of those he’s killed – a macabre detail reflecting his love of death. Key Story Arcs: In the Sanctuary arc, Deathmask guards the Cancer Temple. He fights Dragon Shiryū. At first, he dominates Shiryū, even using Sekishiki Meikai-ha to send Shiryū’s soul to the verge of Hell. However, Shiryū’s righteous Cosmo (aided by Athena’s spirit via Shunrei’s prayer) proves stronger – the Cancer Gold Cloth itself abandons Deathmask for his wickedness, refusing to protect an impure master (Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom) ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=and endowed with the most,not a crisis of faith)). Shiryū, ignited by justice, overpowers Deathmask and punches him off the cliff into Yomotsu Hell, killing him. Deathmask thus falls, literally losing his mask in disbelief as he dies. In the Hades arc, Deathmask is resurrected as one of Hades’s Specters (though still wearing his Cancer Gold Cloth). He and Pisces Aphrodite invade Aries Mu’s house, but Mu soundly defeats them with Stardust Revolution – Deathmask dies again rather disgracefully early in the war ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)) ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Leo Aiolia%2C Aries Mu%2C and,and buried him in Cocytus)). Final Fate: Deathmask’s soul is annihilated at the Wailing Wall along with the other Gold Saints when they combine Cosmo to open the path to Elysion. In Soul of Gold, Deathmask is revived once more in Asgard, where he finds a form of redemption through an unlikely romance (with a villager girl) and fights for good, awakening the Cancer God Cloth to stop Loki. At the end of that series, Deathmask’s attitude changes and he returns to death with a calmer heart. Overall, Deathmask’s legacy is that of a feared, bloodthirsty Saint who ultimately fell from grace. He is remembered for his terrifying technique and the lesson that a Gold Saint devoid of love is unworthy of his Cloth.

Leo Aiolia (Leo Gold Saint)
Leo Aiolia is the Gold Saint of Leo and younger brother of the late Sagittarius Aiolos. Power Level: Aiolia is one of the more prominent Gold Saints and is exceptionally strong and fast. His mastery of lightning Cosmo techniques and hand-to-hand combat is top-notch. Aiolia’s power was demonstrated when he easily handled Bronze Seiya early on, and in Episode G (a spin-off) he battles gods (Titans) directly as the protagonist. He is considered one of the braver and more upfront Gold Saints, often on the front lines. Techniques: Aiolia’s hallmark is lightning speed punches and strikes. His primary technique is Lightning Plasma – Aiolia punches hundreds of times at light-speed, surrounding the enemy with a web of plasma that strikes almost simultaneously ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)). This attack can overwhelm even fast opponents (Seiya with a broken leg could barely evade some of these near light-speed punches). Aiolia also uses Lightning Bolt, a concentrated blast of lightning Cosmo from his fist for a decisive blow. In some media, he has Lightning Fang (a slashing lightning strike). Aiolia’s Cosmo control of lightning is so high that his blows burn and shock at once. Key Story Arcs: During the Sanctuary arc, Aiolia first appears in Japan searching for the “traitors.” He briefly fights Seiya, nearly killing him under Pope Saga’s mind control (via Demon Emperor Fist). Saori stops Aiolia, freeing him from control. Later, at the Leo Temple, Aiolia tests Seiya again. He faces the Bronze Saints but is convinced of their righteousness after seeing their resolve and Athena’s protection. Aiolia becomes one of Athena’s staunchest supporters. In the Hades arc, Aiolia plays a major role. He, along with Mu and Milo, confronts the resurrected Saga, Shura, Camus. Aiolia unleashes his full power (Lightning Plasma) against them, holding his own. When Saga’s group uses Athena Exclamation, Aiolia joins Mu and Milo to answer with their own Exclamation, resulting in a catastrophic stalemate explosion. After Athena’s death, Aiolia is one of the Gold Saints who voluntarily give their blood to revive Athena’s Cloth and then sacrifice their lives at Hades’s Wall. Final Fate: Aiolia dies breaking the Wailing Wall, his proud roar one of the 12 lights that pave the way to Elysion. In Soul of Gold, Aiolia is resurrected in Asgard and becomes effectively the protagonist there; he attains the Leo God Cloth and defeats the evil deity Loki, fulfilling a hero’s role like his brother once did ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=Image%3A Gold)) ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=Image%3A

Virgo Shaka (Virgo Gold Saint)
Virgo Shaka is the Gold Saint of Virgo, often called “the man who is almost a god” due to his immense power and enlightenment ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=the Pope in the,supposed to be Buddha's reincarnation)). Power Level: Shaka is one of the strongest Gold Saints, if not the strongest in pure Cosmo mastery. He is said to possess the “highest cosmos” of the 12 and to be the closest to the gods ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=Shaka alone of all saints,been unusually sensitive to sufferings)). He’s the only Gold Saint of his era with full control of the 8th Sense (Arayashiki), allowing him to freely enter the Underworld alive ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=the

Libra Dohko (Libra Gold Saint)
Libra Dohko is the Gold Saint of Libra, also known as the “Old Master” (Rōshi) at Rozan. Power Level: Dohko is among the oldest and most experienced Saints. Along with Aries Shion, he survived the 18th century Holy War. For over two centuries, Dohko maintained a vigil at the Five Peaks (Lushan) via the Misopetha-Menos technique (given by Athena) that kept him alive with minimal aging. In his prime, Dohko was a mighty Gold Saint – he and Shion presumably equaled the top Gold Saints of the previous era. In the 20th century, Dohko’s true power is revealed only briefly when he returns to youth. His Cosmo as Libra is immense; even Shion acknowledges Dohko’s strength. Techniques and Weapons: Libra’s Cloth is unique in that it carries 12 weapons (pair of swords, spears, tonfas, nunchaku, tridents, and shields) ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=Shaina invades the Undersea Fortress%2C,of Poseidon to defeat him)), which only the Athena (or the Libra Saint with Athena’s approval) can authorize for use. Dohko himself typically fights with his fists and Cosmo. His special attack is Rozan Hyaku Ryū Ha (Hundred Dragons of Rozan) – an upgrade of Shiryū’s techniques, it unleashes one hundred dragon spirits in a torrent, a technique Dohko demonstrated to Shiryū once. In Lost Canvas, Dohko shows mastery of the “Lushan Dragon” techniques similar to Shiryū’s. Additionally, as the Old Master, Dohko had the Misopetha-Menos – not an attack, but a mystical state of suspended aging where his heart beat only 100,000 times per year (instead of millions per day) to preserve his life ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=Shaka is one of the,supposed to be Buddha's reincarnation)). Key Story Arcs: For most of the series, Dohko appears as an old, small monk – the mentor of Dragon Shiryū – at Rozan. He guides Shiryū with wisdom and occasionally communicates with the other Saints telepathically. In the Hades arc, Dohko finally takes action. Sensing Hades’s revival, Dohko stops Misopetha-Menos and instantly reverts to his youthful form – “Young Dohko” – a muscular man in his prime ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=Shaka

Scorpio Milo (Scorpio Gold Saint)
Scorpio Milo is the Gold Saint of Scorpio, characterized as a proud and somewhat impetuous warrior with a strong sense of honor. Power Level: Milo is a formidable Gold Saint who demonstrates the might of the Gold Saints through his “Scarlet Needle” technique that can systematically break an opponent. While not highlighted as the absolute strongest, Milo is clearly very powerful; he held his own against Sea Dragon Kanon for a time and played a key role against the Specters. Techniques: Milo’s signature move is Scarlet Needle, a lethal series of stinging attacks likened to a scorpion’s strikes. He targets the opponent’s nervous system with up to 15 “Needles” – each Needle causes intense pain and paralysis. Milo names each strike after stars of Scorpio (Antares being the final). The 15th Scarlet Needle – Antares – is usually fatal, as it delivers the “Antares” star’s sting to the opponent’s heart ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)). Throughout the fight, Milo’s Needle strikes cause one bleeding puncture each. Additionally, Milo can use Scarlet Needle – Katakeshiki, firing all Needle strikes at once as red lights. Milo’s other move is Restriction, a telekinetic hold (seen in Episode G). Key Story Arcs: In the Sanctuary arc, Milo fights Cygnus Hyōga off-screen at Scorpio Temple. Hyōga arrives already injured; Milo’s Scarlet Needle easily incapacitates him. However, Seiya and Shun’s arrival, and the looming threat to Saori, prompt Milo to stop at 14 Needles, sparing Hyōga out of respect for the Saints’ resolve (and perhaps Camus’s student). After the Sanctuary battle, Milo is fiercely loyal to Athena. In the Poseidon arc (anime only), Milo doesn’t appear, but in side stories he assists in defending Sanctuary. In the Hades arc, Milo plays a prominent role early: he, Aiolia, and Mu confront the trespassing Specter “traitors” (Saga, Camus, Shura). Milo battles Camus, his old friend’s disciple. When Mu is injured, Milo attempts to kill the traitors, but is stopped by Shion. Later, upon learning Athena’s plan, Milo helps orchestrate the Gold Saints’ last stand. Before that, there’s a touching scene where Milo tests Kanon’s loyalty: at Athena’s request, Milo meets Kanon (now reformed) at the Sanctuary coast. Milo strikes Kanon with 14 Scarlet Needles, pushing him to the brink of death to judge if he’s truly on Athena’s side. Kanon does not resist at all. Satisfied, Milo stops before Antares, effectively recognizing Kanon as a fellow Gold Saint and telling him “Live as the man who bears the guilt” ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys

Sagittarius Aiolos (Sagittarius Gold Saint)
Sagittarius Aiolos (Aioros) was the Gold Saint of Sagittarius, remembered as a paragon of virtue. Power Level: Although Aiolos dies before the main events, he was widely regarded by his peers as one of the most powerful and noble Gold Saints. He was the original chosen successor to Pope Shion. Even Virgo Shaka noted Aiolos in his prime could overpower him ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=He wasn’t the strongest Gold,that 5 minutes%2C I believe)). Aiolos’s Cosmo in the Sagittarius Cloth aids the Bronze Saints multiple times, implying his lingering strength. Techniques: Aiolos’s trademark weapon is the Golden Bow and Arrow that comes with the Sagittarius Cloth. As a Saint, he likely used light-speed kicks and blows like his brother Aiolia, though in the story he’s only seen shooting his arrow. The Sagittarius Gold Arrow is extraordinarily powerful – it can pierce nearly any defense when filled with Aiolos’s Cosmo. Athena later repurposed Aiolos’s arrow to save Seiya (to remove the Silver Arrow in her chest). Aiolos also presumably could use the Atomic Thunderbolt (a Sagittarius technique mentioned in some sources) and standard Gold Saint Cosmo blasts. Key Story and Legacy: Though Aiolos doesn’t fight during the series, his backstory sets everything in motion. Thirteen years before the Galaxian Wars, Aiolos discovers the infant Athena being attacked by the corrupted Pope (Saga). Aiolos saves baby Athena and, labeled a traitor by Saga’s deception, is mortally wounded while escaping Sanctuary. He defeats pursuing Saints (Capricorn Shura confronts him; Aiolos still escapes despite injuries). Aiolos entrusts Athena and the Sagittarius Cloth to Mitsumasa Kido before succumbing to his wounds ([Julian Solo | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Julian_Solo#:~:text=This time%2C Poseidon was awakened,is a fan of series)) ([Julian Solo | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Julian_Solo#:~:text=found its DivineTrident ,is a fan of series)). Because of this heroic act, Aiolos is posthumously revered. In the Sanctuary arc, Aiolos’s spirit seemingly guides Seiya at critical moments. When Seiya dons the Sagittarius Gold Cloth against Saga, Aiolos’s image appears and his arrow finds its mark in Saga’s heart (in the anime) to assist Seiya. Throughout the series, the Sagittarius Cloth often comes to the Bronze Saints’ aid as a divine relic of Aiolos’s will. Final Outcome: Aiolos is long dead by the time of the main story, but his legacy lives on. Once Saga’s treachery is exposed, Sanctuary honors Aiolos as a true Saint. His younger brother Aiolia strives to live up to Aiolos’s ideals. In Elysion, the spirit of Aiolos – alongside the other Gold Saints – empowers Seiya and his friends by sending their Gold Cloths to them in the final battle ([Hypnos and Thanatos | Wiki | Saint Seiya Amino Amino](https://aminoapps.com/c/saintseiya_amino/page/item/hypnos-and-thanatos/1WlG_dWirI1ZLJwgWJ24w5ammQv22zGZg#:~:text=terrible fate,taken Athena's Cloth from them)). Thus, Aiolos in death continues to aid Athena. In Next Dimension, which occurs after Hades’s war, the Sagittarius Cloth is without a wearer (Seiya, who might have been a candidate, is injured). Aiolos stands as the gold standard (pun intended) of Saintly virtue in the series: a man who gave everything to protect his goddess.

Capricorn Shura (Capricorn Gold Saint)
Capricorn Shura is the Gold Saint of Capricorn, known as the wielder of “Excalibur.” Power Level: Shura is very powerful in close combat. His loyalty was misused by Saga, but Shura believed himself the “strongest sword” of Athena. In battle, Shura’s Excalibur could slice through almost anything – he mortally wounded Aiolos (though Aiolos was injured and escaping) and later gave Shiryu one of his toughest fights. While perhaps not as cosmically mighty as Saga or Shaka, Shura’s combat skill and absolute dedication made him formidable. Techniques: Shura’s signature ability is Excalibur, an invisible blades-like Cosmo concentrated mostly in his right arm (and edge of legs). With Excalibur, Shura’s chop or kick has the cutting power of a divine sword – he can “cut through anything” with a swipe. Shura also is a master of hand-to-hand; he uses a flying jump kick (as seen against Aiolos and Shiryu). In Episode G, he shows “Jumping Stone” and other strikes, but Excalibur defines him. Key Story Arcs: In Sanctuary, Shura is initially an antagonist out of misguided loyalty to the Pope. In the Capricorn Temple, Shura battles Dragon Shiryu. He dominates initially, as his Excalibur can slice Shiryu’s Dragon Shield and inflict grievous wounds. Shiryu, deciding to sacrifice himself to stop Shura, grabs Shura in a tight hold and triggers his Last Dragon technique – a suicide move propelling both Saint and enemy into the upper atmosphere. As they rocket into space, Shura realizes Shiryu’s resolve mirrors Aiolos’s noble spirit. In a change of heart, Shura decides to save Shiryu: he positions himself to take the brunt of reentry. Shura, burning up on reentry, gifts his Excalibur to Shiryu by embedding the sword’s Cosmo into Shiryu’s arm ([Dragon Shiryu Profile - Angelfire](https://www.angelfire.com/ca/cavalieri/shiryu.html#:~:text=Dragon Shiryu Profile ,Rozan Dragon Flight)). Shura dies on re-entry, while Shiryu survives (though blind). Thus Shura redeems himself by ensuring the Dragon Saint lives and inherits Excalibur. In the Hades arc, Shura is revived as a Specter with Saga and Camus. He participates in the 3-on-1 fight against Shaka and later helps execute Athena’s Exclamation. When Shura reaches Athena, he immediately repents and begs forgiveness for killing Aiolos unjustly – showcasing his genuine remorse and honor. After Athena’s death, Shura and comrades reveal they acted to help her reach Hades. Shura then goes to Pandora’s castle, where he fights Wyvern Rhadamanthys. Rhadamanthys defeats the three renegade Gold Saints (they were weakened to 1/10 power by Hades’s barrier ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=a typhoon))). Shura, last standing, attacks Rhadamanthys, but is cast into Cocytus (the frozen hell). In the end, Shura’s soul joins the Gold Saints at the Wall of Lament – he once again raises his proud Excalibur as the 12 Gold Saints destroy the wall. Final Fate: Shura perishes with the Gold Saints in Elysion’s gate. In Soul of Gold, Shura returns to life briefly in Asgard, regaining Excalibur’s full might and achieving the Capricorn God Cloth to battle Loki. He departs with a smile after settling his regrets. Shura’s legacy is complicated but ultimately honorable: he killed a hero (Aiolos) out of duty, but gave his life to save a new hero (Shiryu) when he realized his error. Shiryu continues to use Excalibur in Shura’s memory, slicing through enemies in the Hades and Omega eras.

Aquarius Camus (Aquarius Gold Saint)
Aquarius Camus is the Gold Saint of Aquarius and master of absolute zero ice techniques, as well as Hyōga’s teacher (in the manga, Hyōga’s direct master; in the anime, Hyōga’s master was Crystal Saint who was Camus’s pupil). Power Level: Camus is extremely powerful and composed. His control over ice and Cosmo is so great he can reach absolute zero (−273.15°C) with his attacks, something even other Gold Saints find difficult. Camus is portrayed as one of the more analytical and sacrificial Gold Saints – willing to die to teach his student. In raw power, he’s on par with other top Golds; he participated in Athena’s Exclamation and fought evenly with Milo and others when necessary. Techniques: Camus’s signature move is Diamond Dust (same named basic attack Hyōga uses, but far stronger in Camus’s hands), a burst of Cosmo that freezes opponents. His ultimate technique is the Aurora Execution, an attack that fires a concentrated wave of sub-zero Cosmo capable of instantly freezing objects (it’s the perfected form of Hyōga’s Aurora Thunder). Camus can also create an “Freezing Coffin” – an unbreakable ice casket (Hyōga and others could not shatter it without Gold Cloths). In the Anime, Camus used Aurora Execution to its fullest against Hyōga, who matched it with his own, resulting in both being encased in ice. Camus is literally a cold genius of battle. Key Story Arcs: In the Sanctuary arc, Camus tests Hyōga severely. First, indirectly at Libra Temple (in the manga) Camus remotely sinks Hyōga in an ice coffin in Siberia to teach him about the resolve needed to be a Saint. Hyōga breaks free and returns. At the Aquarius Temple, Camus faces his disciple Hyōga in a final, dramatic duel. Camus disapproves of Hyōga’s sentimental attachments (like to his mother). Their battle is intense and emotionally charged; Camus uses ever-colder attacks, intending to push Hyōga to the limit. Hyōga does awaken the Seventh Sense and reaches absolute zero momentarily. The duel ends with Camus and Hyōga both executing Aurora Execution – Hyōga’s attack overcomes Camus, flash-freezing him. Camus dies in Hyōga’s arms, proud that his student surpassed him and “has nothing left to teach”. In death, Camus’s last act is to smile, acknowledging Hyōga’s growth. In the Hades arc, Camus is resurrected. Along with Saga and Shura, he infiltrates Sanctuary. Camus battles his friend Milo at first; he takes Milo’s Scarlet Needle punishment without striking back (perhaps out of guilt or strategy). Camus then participates in the confrontation with Shaka. After Shaka’s “death,” Camus and the others reveal their true loyalties and help Athena. Camus ultimately perishes for good at the Wailing Wall with the rest of the Gold Saints, his freezing Cosmo contributing to the wall’s destruction. Final Fate: Camus’s spirit joins his Gold comrades in the afterlife. In Soul of Gold, Camus’s soul is revived in Asgard but initially manipulated by Andreas (Loki); he faces his old friend Milo and protégé Hyōga there, before breaking free of control and helping stop Loki with his God Cloth. Finally, Camus returns to eternal rest, leaving Hyōga as the inheritor of his will (Hyōga even dons the Aquarius Cloth in Next Dimension/Omega era). Camus’s legacy lies in his student – thanks to Camus’s teachings, Hyōga became one of Athena’s greatest Bronze Saints, mastering the very techniques Camus used. Camus himself symbolizes stoicism and the ideal of a mentor who ultimately gives everything to elevate the next generation.

Pisces Aphrodite (Pisces Gold Saint)
Pisces Aphrodite is the Gold Saint of Pisces, notorious for his lethal beauty and use of poisonous roses. Power Level: Aphrodite is deadly to those who underestimate him. He defeated Albior of Cepheus (Andromeda Shun’s Silver Saint master) before the series, proving his might. In direct combat with Bronze Saints, Aphrodite was very dangerous – only Shun’s resolve and nascent Seventh Sense beat him. Among Gold Saints, Aphrodite is often considered not the strongest; in Hades, he’s quickly dispatched by Mu. But his unique poison abilities give him a feared reputation. Techniques: Aphrodite’s weapons are his roses. He has three kinds: Royal Demon Roses (Red Roses), which produce a sweet deadly fragrance that slowly kills and can even put opponents to sleep permanently if inhaled too long ([Eagle Marin | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Marin#:~:text=When Seiya was unconscious,the corpse she discovered there)). These red roses carpet the Pisces Temple and the last path to the Pope’s palace, acting as a trap (only those with strong Cosmo or help survived walking through them) ([Eagle Marin | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Marin#:~:text=When

(Summary of Gold Saints’ Fate: By the end of the Hades chapter, all 12 Gold Saints sacrifice themselves to destroy the Wailing Wall and pave the way for Athena’s Bronze Saints ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=During his first run,Explosion to destroy them both)). This act of collective sacrifice is the ultimate demonstration of their loyalty. Their spirits momentarily aid the Bronze Saints in Elysion by sending the Gold Cloths ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=In 1990%2C the Bronze Saints,18th century%2C Dohko and Shion)). In subsequent stories, Gold Saints are sometimes temporarily revived (e.g., Soul of Gold anime) or shown in flashback, but in the main canon their final fate is this heroic self-sacrifice.)

Poseidon’s Marina Generals (Scales)
Under the sea god Poseidon, his warriors are the Marina Generals, each wearing a Scale armor. There are seven mighty Generals, each guarding one of the seven oceans’ pillars, plus Poseidon himself and his attendants. The Scales correspond to mythical sea creatures. These Generals are often called the “Mariners.” In terms of power, the Marina Generals are roughly comparable to Gold Saints (each General’s Cosmo can overwhelm Bronze Saints, and it took Bronze Saints achieving Seventh Sense or Gold Cloth power-ups to defeat them). Here are the significant Poseidon warriors:

Sea Dragon Kanon (Sea Dragon Scale – North Atlantic Ocean General)
(See also Gemini Kanon in Gold Saints section above.) Sea Dragon Kanon serves Poseidon as the hidden Marina General of the North Atlantic and effectively the leader of the Marinas ([Sea Dragon Kanon | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Dragon_Kanon#:~:text=embracing his destiny as the,シードラゴン のカノン%2C Shīdoragon no Kanon)) ([Sea Dragon Kanon | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Dragon_Kanon#:~:text=Kanon was the one person,honor of a Gold Saint)). Power Level: As mentioned, Kanon (Saga’s twin) is Gold Saint level in Cosmo. Disguised as Sea Dragon, Kanon manipulated the entire Poseidon war. He proved stronger than any other General; even after renouncing evil, he killed multiple Specters and nearly defeated one of Hades’s judges alone. Techniques: In his Sea Dragon persona, Kanon’s special technique was the Golden Triangle, creating a dimensional trap reminiscent of his brother’s Another Dimension ([Respect Sea Dragon/Gemini Kanon (Saint Seiya: Manga Canon)](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/kw0k7f/respect_sea_dragongemini_kanon_saint_seiya_manga/#:~:text=Respect Sea Dragon%2FGemini Kanon ,his enemy there for eternity)). He forms luminous triangles that send the target to the Bermuda Triangle dimension from which escape is nearly impossible ([Respect Sea Dragon/Gemini Kanon (Saint Seiya: Manga Canon)](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/kw0k7f/respect_sea_dragongemini_kanon_saint_seiya_manga/#:~:text=Respect

Siren Sorento (Siren Scale – South Atlantic Ocean General)
Siren Sorento (Sorrento) is the Marina General of the South Atlantic, recognizable by his flute. Power Level: Sorento is among the most intriguing Generals – he possesses a mix of brute power and musical Cosmo. He defeated Aldebaran (by injuring his soul with music) and fought evenly with Bronze Saints. After Kanon, Sorento is implied to be the strongest General ([Sorrento after the Poseidon saga ? : r/SaintSeiya - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintSeiya/comments/lm79zg/sorrento_after_the_poseidon_saga/#:~:text=Sorrento after the Poseidon saga,the strongest General excluding Kanon)) (and in fact one of the few survivors). Techniques: Sorento’s primary weapon is his# Saint Seiya Armors and Warriors by Class

The Saint Seiya franchise features various classes of divine armor, each associated with different gods and factions. Below, the analysis is organized by armor class:

Cloths – Worn by Athena’s Saints (sub-divided into Bronze, Silver, and Gold Saints).
Scales – Worn by Poseidon’s Marina Generals.
Surplices – Worn by Hades’s 108 Specters.
God Robes – Worn by Odin’s God Warriors (Asgard).
Others – Special cases (Steel Saints, Saintia, etc.).
For each class, we list significant characters, their power level/ranking, signature techniques, key story arcs, and final outcomes in the story. Major canonical sources include Kurumada’s original manga, the anime adaptation, and notable spin-offs like The Lost Canvas, Saintia Shō, Omega, and Next Dimension.

(Note: “Power level” is described in terms of general combat prowess and Cosmo mastery, since explicit numeric power levels aren’t given. All citations refer to official information from the series.)

Bronze Saints (Athena’s Bronze Cloths)
Bronze Saints are the lowest-ranked of Athena’s 88 Saints. They wear Bronze Cloths and at first possess only basic Cosmo skills. A typical Bronze Saint can move at supersonic speeds (around Mach 1) and throw 100 punches per second – impressive, but only a “small part of the power of Gold Saints” ([Bronze Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_Saints#::text=Bronze Saints wear the Bronze,the power of Gold saints)). Their role is usually to assist higher-ranked Saints ([Bronze Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_Saints#:~:text=There are 48 Bronze Saints%2C,number among the 88 Saints)). However, the five main Bronze Saints (the protagonists) break this mold: through intense battles they awaken the Seventh Sense (the essence of Cosmo) and even attain godly Cloths, allowing them to fight on par with or above Gold Saints ([Bronze Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_Saints#:~:text=Although Bronze Saints usually have,Tenma from 75)) ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=In 1990%2C the Bronze Saints,18th century%2C Dohko and Shion)). Below are key Bronze Saints:

Pegasus Seiya – Bronze Saint of Pegasus
Power Level/Ranking: Initially a low-tier Saint, Seiya’s Cosmo grows exponentially. Under mentor Marin’s training, Seiya awakens the Seventh Sense, elevating him to Gold Saint-level combat ([Pegasus Seiya | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Seiya#:~:text=Seiya%2C a Bronze Saint%2C is,likes of which rarely ever)). For example, during his fight with Taurus Aldebaran, Seiya burns his Cosmo to achieve power equal to a Gold Saint, shattering Aldebaran’s horn with a punch ([Pegasus Seiya | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Seiya#:~:text=Seiya%2C

Signature Techniques: Pegasus Ryūsei Ken (Pegasus Meteor Fist) – a rapid-fire barrage of punches like meteor streaks. Pegasus Sūsei Ken (Comet Fist) – a single, focused punch with all his Cosmo. Pegasus Rolling Crush – Seiya grabs the enemy and soars, then plummets down, crushing them on impact. These techniques, taught by Marin, become far more potent as Seiya’s Cosmo increases. By the Hades arc, Seiya’s punches and kicks reach light-speed and beyond ([Pegasus Seiya | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Seiya#:~:text=,His durability is)).

Key Story Arcs: Seiya wins the Galaxian Wars tournament and becomes Athena’s champion. In the Sanctuary arc, he battles through the 12 Zodiac Temples, delivering the final blow to Gemini Saga (the false Pope) with the golden Sagittarius arrow. In the Poseidon arc, Seiya obtains the Sagittarius Gold Cloth and uses Athena’s Cosmo to shatter Poseidon’s main pillar. In the Hades arc, Seiya’s Cosmo burns so brightly that he, with his fellow Bronze Saints, obtains a God Cloth to strike down Hades ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=In 1990%2C the Bronze Saints,18th century%2C Dohko and Shion)). He is critically wounded by Hades’s sword while protecting Athena ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension (Manga) - TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaNextDimension#:~:text=During the final battle between,and give her the)).

Final Outcome: After Hades’s defeat, Seiya is left cursed and comatose, struck by Hades’s sword. He “survived his death but is under a curse from Hades’ sword that will kill him in three days” ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=In the present time%2C Pegasus,is in league with Hades)). In Next Dimension (the sequel), Athena travels to the past seeking Seiya’s cure. At the story’s latest point, Seiya remains alive but wheelchair-bound, his fate hinging on the Holy War’s outcome. Despite this tragic turn, Seiya’s legacy as the “Saint who would slay Hades” is cemented ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=Next Dimension resumes the story,a boy named Alone%2C Hades)).

Dragon Shiryū – Bronze Saint of Dragon
Power Level/Ranking: Shiryū is initially one of the physically strongest Bronze Saints and the most disciplined. Under Libra Dohko’s tutelage, he learns to raise his Cosmo to the Seventh Sense and even touch the Eighth Sense briefly. By the Hades arc, Shiryū in his prime can fight Specters on Gold Saint level. Notably, Shiryū inherits the Gold Libra Cloth in later arcs and is deemed worthy of it. He is often called the most mature of the Bronze Five ([Dragon Shiryū - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Shiryū#:~:text=franchise %2C he has made,adopted granddaughter%2C Saori%2C Athena's reincarnation)).

Signature Techniques: Rozan Shōryū Ha (Rising Dragon) – an upward punch unleashing a Cosmo dragon ([Dragon Shiryu Profile - Angelfire](https://www.angelfire.com/ca/cavalieri/shiryu.html#:~:text=Dragon Shiryu Profile ,Rozan Dragon Flight)). Rozan Ryū Hi Shō (Hundred Dragons) – Shiryū’s ultimate move, learned from Dohko, which fires one hundred dragon spirits (used in extremis). Excalibur – Shiryū’s right arm houses Capricorn Shura’s “sword” after Shura’s death, enabling Shiryū to perform a lightspeed sword-hand strike that can cut through almost anything ([Dragon Shiryu Profile - Angelfire](https://www.angelfire.com/ca/cavalieri/shiryu.html#:~:text=Dragon

Key Story Arcs: Shiryū’s notable victories include defeating Perseus Algol by blinding himself (Sense | Seiyapedia | Fandom), vanquishing Cancer Deathmask at the verge of the Underworld, and destroying Chrysaor Krishna’s spear undersea by awakening the 7th sense. In the 12 Temples, Shiryū’s most heroic moment is against Capricorn Shura – Shiryū performs a suicide Last Dragon technique, grappling Shura and launching both into space. Moved by Shiryū’s bravery, Shura spares him and perishes, gifting Shiryū the Excalibur sword in his arm ([Dragon Shiryu Profile - Angelfire](https://www.angelfire.com/ca/cavalieri/shiryu.html#:~:text=Dragon Shiryu Profile ,Rozan Dragon Flight)). During the Hades arc, Shiryū regains his lost sight and dons the Libra Gold Cloth to aid Seiya. He and Hyōga defeat Griffon Minos together, and Shiryū is among the last Bronze Saints standing in Elysion.

Final Outcome: Shiryū survives the Holy Wars. At series end, he returns to Rozan and, in some continuities, marries Shunrei. Eventually, he succeeds his master as the Libra Gold Saint. In Next Dimension/Omega, Shiryū is depicted as a veteran warrior training the next generation (and even has a son, Ryūhō). Thus, Shiryū’s final fate is peaceful: living on to guide the future Saints, having fulfilled his duty and earned the rank of Gold Saint.

Cygnus Hyōga – Bronze Saint of Cygnus
Power Level/Ranking: Trained by Aquarius Camus, Hyōga commands absolute zero ice techniques. Early on, he is a mid-tier Bronze, but through battles (especially against his master) he awakens the Seventh Sense. By the Poseidon and Hades arcs, Hyōga’s power rivals Gold Saints – he can freeze even divine surplices. In the final battle, Hyōga dons the Cygnus God Cloth, marking him as one of Athena’s top Bronze Saints ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=In 1990%2C the Bronze Saints,18th century%2C Dohko and Shion)). He’s often seen as slightly below Seiya/Ikki in raw power, but his potential is enormous (Camus noted Hyōga could surpass him).

Signature Techniques: Diamond Dust – a burst of frosty Cosmo; Hyōga’s classic move inherited from his master ([Lyra Orphée (Character) - Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/orphee-saint-of-lyra/4005-49907/#:~:text=Lyra Orphée%2C though a Silver,his skill with the lyre)). Aurora Thunder Attack (also called Kholodny Smerch) – a stronger blizzard strike. Aurora Execution – Camus’s ultimate technique which Hyōga masters; an absolute-zero beam of Cosmo capable of flash-freezing opponents. Hyōga also employs the Freezing Coffin, encasing foes in unbreakable ice (only Gold or divine power can break his ice). His Cosmo can drop the temperature to absolute zero, literally freezing Gold Saints in their tracks.

Key Story Arcs: Hyōga’s journey is one of emotional growth. In the Sanctuary arc, Hyōga’s most defining fight is against Aquarius Camus at the Aquarius Temple. Camus pushes Hyōga to abandon sentimentality; their clash of Aurora Execution vs. Aurora Execution ends with Hyōga reaching absolute zero, freezing Camus to death ([Dragon Shiryū - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Shiryū#:~:text=durable Bronze Cloths,need%2C the five main Bronze)). In the Poseidon arc, Hyōga confronts Kraken Isaac (his childhood friend-turned-General) and uses Aurora Execution to win. He destroys the Arctic Pillar, fulfilling his duty. During the Hades arc, Hyōga attains the Eighth Sense to enter the underworld alive. Teaming with Shiryū, he battles Griffon Minos – together they annihilate Minos (Hyōga shatters Minos’s Surplice with a point-blank Aurora Execution). In Elysion, Hyōga wears the Aquarius Gold Cloth (temporarily bestowed) and later his Cygnus God Cloth to fight Hypnos.

Final Outcome: Hyōga survives and, after the wars, is often depicted traveling (in Omega, an older Hyōga wanders Siberia helping people). In one continuity, Hyōga becomes the Aquarius Gold Saint, fully stepping into his master’s role. Ultimately, Hyōga’s fate is to live in serenity, guarding the memory of his mother and mentor, and serving Athena when needed. His training of the next generation (e.g., he mentors the “Blue Warriors” in manga side stories) hints that Hyōga continues as a protector of peace.

Andromeda Shun – Bronze Saint of Andromeda
Power Level/Ranking: Shun is known as the most gentle Bronze Saint, yet his Cosmo holds incredible latent power – when fully unleashed, Shun’s power is immense. Shun awakens the Seventh Sense during the Sanctuary battles and even briefly hosts the spirit of Hades (a testament to his “undefiled” soul). Though Shun dislikes violence, when pushed he can overpower Gold Saints and even gods. In the final arc, Shun’s Cosmo in his Andromeda God Cloth contributes heavily to Hades’s defeat.

Signature Techniques: Andromeda Nebula Chain – Shun wields chains with two ends (Round Shield and Triangle) that act both offensively and defensively. The chains can attack (Thunder Wave), defend (forming a Circular Barrier), or seek the enemy’s location. They react automatically to danger. Shun’s ultimate move is Nebula Storm – by removing his restraining chains, Shun releases a Cosmo whirlwind from the Andromeda Nebula that can obliterate even the strongest opponents. (He used Nebula Storm sparingly, as it is lethal and Shun is pacifist.) The Nebula Chain itself is famous for adapting – it broke through Aphrodite’s piranha roses and even held off gods briefly.

Key Story Arcs: Shun often tries diplomacy first. In the Sanctuary arc, he defeats Pisces Aphrodite by finally unleashing Nebula Storm in anger over his friends’ injuries, killing the Gold Saint at the cost of severe wounds ([Lyra Orphée | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Lyra_Orphée#:~:text=Image%3A Lyra Orphée playing lyre,Pope and the Gold Saints)) ([Lyra Orphée | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Lyra_Orph

Final Outcome: Shun survives and returns to a peaceful life, vowing never to fight unless absolutely necessary. At the end of Hades’s war, Shun is seen caring for Seiya, and in Next Dimension he takes action to save his brother and friends by traveling to Olympus with Athena. In Saint Seiya Omega, an older Shun has retired as a Saint (his Cosmo was sealed in a past incident), becoming a physician who aids the new generation with knowledge instead of combat. Shun’s fate is one of tranquility – the “Calm Saint” who, having fulfilled his role in battle, now embodies mercy and healing.

Phoenix Ikki – Bronze Saint of Phoenix
Power Level/Ranking: Ikki is the strongest Bronze Saint at the beginning and remains a wildcard powerhouse throughout. He has an indomitable fighting spirit – Ikki’s Cosmo grows stronger every time he’s “killed,” as he resurrects from his ashes like his Phoenix Cloth. By the end, Ikki’s power is rivaling Gold Saints and beyond; he defeats one of Hades’s Judges single-handedly and even confronts the god Hades directly. He’s known for taking on foes no one else can handle, earning a reputation as Athena’s mightiest Bronze fighter (especially when enraged).

Signature Techniques: Hōō Genma Ken (Phoenix Illusion Demon Fist) – a psychic attack that invades the opponent’s mind with terrifying hallucinations, often breaking their spirit or controlling them ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=They both have incredible mind,let’s not forget what happened)). This technique allowed Ikki to mind-shatter weaker opponents or turn them against allies (he used it to nearly brainwash Shaka, and to free Kanon from guilt) ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=They

Key Story Arcs: Ikki debuts as an antagonist, leading the Black Saints. After being defeated (and shown mercy) by Seiya and Shun, Ikki turns to the side of good. In the Sanctuary arc, Ikki often arrives as the last-resort savior. His iconic battle is against Virgo Shaka. Facing Shaka’s overwhelming “Treasure of the Heavens” technique, Ikki has all his senses removed ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=All of his techniques are,dying%2C could escape from that)). Refusing to surrender, Ikki uses the last of his Cosmo to strike Shaka with the Genma Ken and then self-destructs – a gambit that momentarily takes Shaka out of the fight. Ikki is later resurrected from the ashes. In the Poseidon arc, Ikki confronts Sea Dragon Kanon. He resists Kanon’s Golden Triangle and uses the Demon Illusion Fist to pry out Kanon’s guilt ([Respect Sea Dragon/Gemini Kanon (Saint Seiya: Manga Canon)](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/kw0k7f/respect_sea_dragongemini_kanon_saint_seiya_manga/#:~:text=Respect Sea Dragon%2FGemini Kanon ,his enemy there for eternity)) ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=They both have incredible mind,let’s not forget what happened)). Ikki nearly kills Kanon, but Athena’s intervention stops him, and Ikki convinces Kanon to repent. In the Hades arc, Ikki infiltrates the Underworld on his own. He famously defeats Garuda Aiacos (one of the 3 Judges of Hell) with relative ease – Aiacos falls to Ikki’s Phoenix Wings attack and a crushing blow ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Leo Aiolia%2C Aries Mu%2C and,and buried him in Cocytus)). Ikki then battles Wyvern Rhadamanthys; although initially overwhelmed (due to Hades’s barrier weakening Ikki), he returns empowered (once the barrier drops) and finishes Rhadamanthys alongside Kanon ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=During his first run,Explosion to destroy them both)). Ikki is the only Bronze Saint to reach Elysion without Athena’s blood blessing – he storms into Hades’s palace to protect his brother. In the final showdown, Ikki engages the god Hades to buy time, surviving hits that obliterate Gold Cloths, until Hades strikes him down. Even then, Ikki’s life is spared by divine intervention.

Final Outcome: Ikki survives the war and, true to his nature, departs to live in solitude. In the epilogue, Ikki chooses to reside on Cannon Island (Death Queen Island) alone, watching over the world from the shadows. He’s ever ready to return if evil threatens. Next Dimension shows Ikki summoned to face Apollo’s angels, reaffirming that Phoenix Ikki continues as Athena’s ever-vigilant guardian. His fate is tied to his immortal Phoenix – he wanders, training and guarding, free of attachments, yet always there when the universe needs an indestructible champion.

Other Notable Bronze Saints: Beyond the main five, several secondary Bronze Saints appear. These include the contestants of the Galaxian Wars: Unicorn Jabu, Bear Geki, Lionet Ban, Wolf Nachi, and Hydra Ichi – each possessing a minor Bronze Cloth. They are initially Seiya’s rivals but later aid Saori Kido (Athena) as loyal supporters. For example, Jabu and the others protect Saori during the Sanctuary invasion (albeit off-screen) and evacuate civilians ([Bronze Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_Saints#:~:text=Other Bronze Saints in the,tend to remain minor characters)). Their power is far below the main Bronze Saints, and they mostly play supportive roles post-Galaxian Wars. Notably, The Lost Canvas (18th century) features Unicorn Yato and Crane Yuzuriha as Bronze Saints allied with Pegasus Tenma, illustrating that in every era there are minor Bronze Saints who assist the protagonists ([Bronze Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_Saints#:~:text=Although Bronze Saints usually have,Tenma from 75)). Generally, these lesser Bronze Saints survive the conflicts and guard Athena in minor capacities.

(Bronze Saints Summary: Bronze Saints start as the “foot soldiers” of Athena – limited in Cosmo and duty ([Bronze Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_Saints#:~:text=Bronze Saints wear the Bronze,the power of Gold saints)). Yet, the core Bronze Saints shatter those limits, “burning their Cosmo beyond ordinary levels…even beyond Silver Saints” ([Bronze Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_Saints#:~:text=Although Bronze Saints usually have,Tenma from 75)). By the end, they perform miracles (defeating Olympian gods) through awakening the Seventh Sense and donning God Cloths ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=In 1990%2C the Bronze Saints,18th century%2C Dohko and Shion)). Their fates range from tragic (Seiya’s coma) to peaceful (Shun and Hyōga’s retirements) to ever-vigilant (Ikki’s wandering).)*

Silver Saints (Athena’s Silver Cloths)
Silver Saints are mid-ranked Athena Saints, wearing Silver Cloths of constellations outside the Zodiac. They are much stronger than typical Bronze Saints – “far superior to those of Bronze Saints” in Cosmo mastery and combat ([Ophiuchus Shaina (Character) - Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ophiuchus-shaina/4005-45451/#:~:text=As a Silver Saint%2C Shaina,those of Bronze Saints%2C)). Silver Saints can move at multi-mach speeds and have refined techniques. However, they are still below Gold Saints. In the series, Silver Saints often serve as early arc antagonists or mentors. A few exceptional Silvers (like Orphée) reach Gold-level Cosmo, but generally they are stepping stones for the Bronze heroes. Key Silver Saints include:

Eagle Marin – Silver Saint of Aquila (Eagle)
Power Level/Ranking: Marin is a high-tier Silver Saint and Pegasus Seiya’s instructor. She possesses profound knowledge of Cosmo and advanced combat techniques. Marin easily defeated low-level Saints (she handled Shaina’s underlings and protected Seiya from other Silvers). While not on Gold level, Marin’s skills impressed even Gold Saints – she survived encounters with Pisces Aphrodite and Poseidon’s generals with minor injuries. As Seiya’s mentor, Marin is critical in raising a Bronze to Gold-level power.

Signature Techniques: Ryūsei Ken (Meteor Punch) – Marin’s version of the Pegasus Meteor Fist, a rapid flurry of punches ([Eagle Marin | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Marin#:~:text=creation of illusions,Lizard Misty from killing him)). (She taught this technique to Seiya; since she isn’t Pegasus, her strikes aren’t named “Pegasus” Meteor, but the principle is the same ([Eagle Marin | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Marin#:~:text=creation

Key Story Arcs: Marin trains Seiya in Sanctuary’s training ground and then watches over him. In the Galaxian Wars, Marin remains in the shadows. When Sanctuary sends Silver assassins, Marin betrays Sanctuary to protect Seiya, thus being labeled a traitor ([Eagle Marin | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Marin#:~:text=When Marin separated from Seiya,the Sanctuary to help Seiya)). She fights Hound Asterion and Lizard Misty – using her wits and Kūken to save Seiya ([Eagle Marin | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Marin#:~:text=,Lizard Misty from killing him)). Marin later investigates Pope Ares’s identity: she climbs Star Hill (forbidden area) and discovers the corpse of the real Pope (Shion), unveiling Saga’s imposture ([Eagle Marin | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Marin#:~:text=When

Ophiuchus Shaina – Silver Saint of Ophiuchus (Serpent Bearer)
Power Level/Ranking: Shaina is a formidable Silver Saint, known initially as Seiya’s relentless pursuer. She is physically very strong (able to casually defeat an unarmored Seiya early on) and her Cosmo is high for a Silver. While she cannot best a Gold Saint, Shaina’s power is feared among Bronze Saints – even Phoenix Ikki acknowledged her strength when they briefly fought. After the Sanctuary arc, Shaina is promoted to Captain of Athena’s Guards ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=Shaina has been promoted to,invasion route of the enemy)), reflecting her high standing among Silver Saints.

Signature Techniques: Thunder Claw – Shaina’s trademark move, where she lunges with her hand in a claw shape, releasing slashing waves of Cosmo that electrocute and tear the opponent ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=Thunder Claw ,and by the sharp claws)). It’s said to mimic a cobra’s strike, befitting her constellation. “The enemy ends up being damaged both by the electric shock and by the sharp claws.” ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=Thunder

Key Story Arcs: Shaina initially appears as an antagonist. As a female Saint, she’s bound by the rule that any man who sees her face must be killed or become her beloved. When Seiya shatters Shaina’s mask by accident, she swears to kill him ([Pegasus Seiya | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Seiya#:~:text=she got personally involved in,3)). Throughout the Galaxian Wars, Shaina ambushes Seiya multiple times – sending her pupil Cassios to fight him, and later attacking Seiya herself with Thunder Claws. Despite her fury, Shaina develops conflicted feelings: Seiya’s compassion (saving her from Cassios’s out-of-control attack) causes her to secretly fall in love with him, complicating the “love or kill” law. In the Silver Saints arc, Shaina tries to kill Seiya during his fight with Perseus Algol but is stopped by Ikki. She is injured, and Seiya spares her again. Her affection for Seiya crystalizes in the Poseidon arc (anime): when Seiya (wearing Sagittarius Cloth) is about to be struck by Poseidon’s returning trident, Shaina jumps in and takes the hit, nearly dying to protect Seiya ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=embodying Poseidon's powers,the Seas is sealed again)). She confesses her love as she falls unconscious. Seiya’s tears and Cosmo help revive her. After this, Shaina’s antagonism ends. In the Hades arc, Shaina is shown leading Sanctuary’s defense in the Bronze Saints’ absence ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=Shaina has been promoted to,invasion route of the enemy)). She also helps fend off Poseidon’s ghostly attack on Seiya’s sister in the Hades OVAs, and in Next Dimension Shaina stands guard over Seiya’s comatose body, battling enemy deities’ minions with Marin ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=Image%3A Os Image%3A Os)). Final Outcome: Shaina survives the Holy Wars. She continues as a loyal Saint, now acknowledged as one of Athena’s most trustworthy Silver warriors. She presumably trains new Saints (in Omega, Shaina mentors Kouga, the new Pegasus). While her love for Seiya remains mostly unspoken, Shaina finds purpose in protecting Athena’s Sanctuary. In summation, Ophiuchus Shaina’s journey is from vengeful adversary to one of Athena’s bravest defenders. By the end, she has “a relationship with Seiya of camaraderie and respect” ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=Shaina

Lyra Orphée (Lyra Orpheus) – Silver Saint of Lyra
Power Level/Ranking: Orphée is an extraordinary Silver Saint – “his control of Cosmo was so great that he gained the reputation of being above the level of Gold Saints” ([Lyra Orphée | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Lyra_Orphée#:~:text=Lyra Orphée was not only,the love of his life)). He is often touted as the most powerful Silver Saint in history, such that even Gold Saints and Specters revered him. In the Hades arc, he nearly defeated a god (Hades) through his skill. This places Orphée in a unique tier: a Silver Saint with Gold+ might.

Signature Techniques: Orphée uses a lyre (harp) to fight, his music directly affecting opponents’ bodies and souls. Stringer Nocturne – a deadly melody where lyre strings generate electric shockwaves, trapping the target in a fatal illusion of darkness (Lyra Orphée | Seiyapedia | Fandom). Death Trip Serenade – a requiem that lulls foes into deep sleep or even eternal slumber ([Lyra Orphée | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Lyra_Orph

Key Story Arcs: Orphée’s story parallels the myth of Orpheus. In Kurumada’s manga, he withdrew from Sanctuary after his lover Eurydice died and was partially resurrected in the Underworld (kept in a half-alive state by Hades). Orphée entered Hades’s realm voluntarily, playing music to soothe Hades in hopes of reviving Eurydice. By the time of the Hades arc, Orphée resides in the Underworld, pretending to serve Hades. When Bronze Saints Shun and Seiya reach him, Orphée reveals his true loyalty is to Athena. In an attempt to kill Hades (in his host body) and Pandora, Orphée plays his Stringer Fine: the shockwaves nearly destroy Griffon Minos (one of the Judges) and stun Hades’s vessel. However, Wyvern Rhadamanthys, who had blocked his ears, attacks Orphée from behind, mortally wounding him ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Leo Aiolia%2C Aries Mu%2C and,and buried him in Cocytus)). Dying, Orphée musters enough strength to pin down Rhadamanthys momentarily with his last melody, allowing Seiya and Shun to escape. Orphée’s life ends in the Underworld; he finally reunites with Eurydice in death.

Final Outcome: Orphée dies heroically, having almost succeeded in an assassination of a god. After Hades’s defeat, Athena ensures Orphée and Eurydice find peace (breaking Eurydice’s cursed half-life). Orphée’s legend lives on among Saints – he’s remembered as “the legendary Silver Saint from the old poems” ([Lyra Orpheus | Seiyapedia - Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Lyra_Orpheus#:~:text=Orpheus is the legendary mythical,Saint from the old poems)). His unmatched music-based Cosmo and the sacrifice he made solidify him as a Silver Saint who achieved the greatness of a Gold Saint and the purity of a mythic hero.

Other Silver Saints:
Crane Yuzuriha (Silver Saint of Crane) – featured in The Lost Canvas, an 18th-century female Silver Saint who fights Specters alongside Bronze Saints. She is a competent warrior and one of few female Saints to not wear a mask (as Saintia).
Cepheus Daidalos (Albiore) – in anime continuity, master of Andromeda Island. He was a Silver Saint who trained Shun. Pisces Aphrodite killed him treacherously to secure his Gold Saint candidacy.
Perseus Algol – Silver Saint who wielded the Medusa Shield to turn opponents to stone. He nearly defeated Shiryū, but Shiryū’s self-blinding countered him (Sense | Seiyapedia | Fandom). Algol was defeated and killed by Shiryū.
Sagitta Ptolemy – Silver Saint of Sagitta (Arrow). He shot the golden arrow that struck Athena’s heart, giving the Bronze Saints 12 hours to save her. Seiya defeated him with aid from Marin.
Lizard Misty – a vain Silver Saint who fought Seiya on the beach. Seiya managed to defeat Misty by burning his Cosmo beyond Misty’s expectations. Misty’s poisonous wind and “Mighty Ocean Waves” were formidable but ultimately failed.
Hound Asterion – a Silver Saint with mind-reading abilities. Marin outsmarted and defeated Asterion (breaking his concentration with illusions) ([Eagle Marin | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Marin#:~:text=,Lizard Misty from killing him)).
Southern Cross (Crux) Christ – in anime, Hyōga’s friend and a Silver Saint referred to as “Crystal Saint.” He was brainwashed by Sanctuary and fought Hyōga, but Hyōga freed him before his death.
Auriga Capella, Canis Major Dio, etc. – minor Silver Saints who appear briefly and are defeated by Bronze Saints during the Silver Saint rebellion.
Most Silver Saints meet grim ends during the Sanctuary arc (defeated by Bronze Saints or executed by Sanctuary for failure). Those who survive (Marin, Shaina, a few others) become staunch Athena supporters. General Note: Silver Saints, while powerful, serve as the bridge between the “human” level of Bronze Saints and the “divine” level of Gold Saints. As the franchise progresses, Bronze Saints overtake them, but Silver Saints’ dedication (Marin’s guidance, Shaina’s bravery, Orphée’s sacrifice) proves crucial to Athena’s victories.

Gold Saints (Athena’s Gold Cloths)
Gold Saints are the twelve elite warriors of Athena, each guarding one Zodiac Temple. They wear Gold Cloths representing the 12 zodiac constellations and are known as the most powerful Saints ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=Gold Saints wear Gold Cloths,and light of the sun)) ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=upcoming crisis)). Each Gold Saint has mastered the Seventh Sense – the essence of Cosmo – which grants them lightspeed movement and tremendous destructive power ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=upcoming

Aries Mū – Gold Saint of Aries
Power Level/Ranking: Mu is the Gold Saint of Aries and a master of psychokinesis (telekinesis and teleportation). He is also one of only two living survivors of the previous Holy War (pupil of Aries Shion). Mu’s power is considerable: he easily defeated two resurrected Gold Saints (Deathmask and Aphrodite) without taking a scratch ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)) ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Hades led him to question,the force of a typhoon)). Among his generation, Mu is respected as one of the wiser and more technically skilled Gold Saints (often acting as a strategist and support). He’s perhaps not as purely overpowering as Saga or Shaka in direct combat, but his abilities in defense and teleportation are second to none.

Signature Techniques: Crystal Wall – Mu erects a transparent psychokinetic barrier that can block almost any attack. It shielded him from giant explosions and multiple foes until its limit was reached. Starlight Extinction – Mu’s teleportation attack: he warps the target away into another dimension or simply disintegrates them with telekinetic force. He used Starlight Extinction to vanish Deathmask and Aphrodite from existence in an eye-blink ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Hades led him to question,the force of a typhoon)). Stardust Revolution – a flurry of lights (stars) blasting the enemy at lightspeed; it’s Mu’s offensive barrage, used effectively against Specters. Mu also has miscellaneous psychic powers: illusion casting, telepathy, and the unique skill to repair Cloths (he’s a gifted armorsmith).

Key Story Arcs: In the 12 Temples arc, Mu initially stays at Jamir, helping repair the Bronze Cloths and training the Bronze Saints in the concept of Cosmo. When Seiya’s group arrives at Aries Temple, Mu tests them briefly then lets them pass, healing their injuries – signifying the true start of their Twelve Houses challenge with his blessing. During the Hades arc, Mu takes center stage early: he fights off Saga, Camus, and Shura at Aries. Mu holds his own using Crystal Wall and Starlight Extinction, but the trio’s combined attack (Athena Exclamation) overcomes him, and he’s wounded. Mu later assists in protecting Athena – he is present when she “dies” to reach Hades. At Hades’s Inferno, Mu joins Aiolia and Milo in confronting Rhadamanthys at Pandemonium. However, under Hades’s barrier their power is reduced to 1/10th, and Rhadamanthys defeats them (Mu is knocked out and tossed into Cocytus) ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=a typhoon)). Mu’s final act is at the Wailing Wall: he and the other Gold Saints burn their lives to break the barrier to Elysion ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=When three Gold Saints come,Because of its immense)).

Final Outcome: Mu perishes along with the other Gold Saints in the ultimate sacrifice. In Soul of Gold, Mu’s soul revives in Asgard and he attains the Aries God Cloth to help defeat Loki. After that temporary revival, Mu returns to eternal rest. He entrusts the Aries Gold Cloth (and the duty of armor restoration) to his own apprentice, Kiki, who indeed becomes the next Aries Gold Saint. Mu’s legacy is that of a calm, wise guardian. He was pivotal in enabling the Bronze Saints’ victories (through repairs and guidance) and exemplified loyalty by giving his life for Athena.

Taurus Aldebaran – Gold Saint of Taurus
Power Level/Ranking: Aldebaran is the Gold Saint of Taurus, known for raw strength. Physically, he’s arguably the mightiest of the Gold Saints (he stopped Seiya’s Meteor punches with sheer muscle early on). Aldebaran might not be the fastest Gold Saint, but his durability and power are immense – his Great Horn attack can blow away most opponents in one hit. However, among Gold Saints, Aldebaran sometimes is used to showcase an enemy’s strength (he is ambushed in Hades arc and falls early). That said, it took tricks or overwhelming force to bring him down. He is revered by Bronze Saints as a friendly “big brother” figure among the Golds.

Signature Techniques: Great Horn – Aldebaran’s signature move, a double-fist strike or thrust that releases a powerful wave of Cosmo shaped like a bull’s horns. It’s usually performed with arms spread then slammed together, and it carries massive force. Seiya described it as like being hit by a huge bull head-on. Great Horn was strong enough that Seiya with 7th sense could only deflect it by breaking one of Aldebaran’s horns (a symbolic gesture that impressed Aldebaran) ([Pegasus Seiya | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Seiya#:~:text=Seiya%2C a Bronze Saint%2C is,likes of which rarely ever)). Aldebaran can also use brute moves (shoulder tackles, etc.), but Great Horn defines his style. In Soul of Gold, he shows Titan’s Nova (a stronger Horn) and Sweeping Horn (a wide-range strike).

Key Story Arcs: In the Sanctuary arc, Aldebaran confronts Pegasus Seiya at the Taurus Temple. He overwhelms Seiya at first, knocking him around. As Seiya’s Cosmo rises, Aldebaran challenges him to break one of his giant horns as proof of strength. Seiya attains a new level of speed (light-speed Seventh Sense) and succeeds ([Pegasus Seiya | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Seiya#:~:text=Seiya%2C a Bronze Saint%2C is,likes of which rarely ever)). Smiling, Aldebaran yields – he acknowledges Seiya’s potential and lets the Bronze Saints pass, showing his honorable nature. In the Poseidon (anime) arc, Aldebaran is sent to investigate Asgard. There he fights Siren Sorento (who was secretly sowing chaos). Sorento’s deadly flute melody “Dead End Symphony” incapacitates Aldebaran; he’s found badly injured with bleeding ears (he survives, but is out of the battle). In the Hades arc, Aldebaran faces Deep Niobe (a Specter) at Sanctuary. Aldebaran easily kills Niobe with Great Horn, not realizing Niobe had already released a poisonous gas as a suicide attack. Aldebaran succumbs to the invisible Perfume after winning – he dies standing upright in Taurus Temple, his body turned to stone by the gas ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=other,of Poseidon to defeat him)). This shocks the other Saints (Mu later finds his body still standing). Despite this early exit, Aldebaran’s Cosmo flares later as one of the 12 giving energy at the Wailing Wall.

Final Outcome: Aldebaran’s life ends in the Hades arc, making him one of the few Gold Saints to die before the final Wall sacrifice. Nonetheless, his spirit joins the other Golds in sending Cosmo to destroy the Wall ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=When three Gold Saints come,Because of its immense)). In Soul of Gold, Aldebaran’s soul is revived – he has a touching subplot mentoring a young Asgardian boy and regains his Gold Cloth (achieving God Cloth) to help defeat Loki. With Asgard saved, Aldebaran returns to eternal rest with pride. After him, the Taurus Gold Cloth eventually finds a new wielder (in Omega, Taurus Harbinger picks up the mantle). Aldebaran is remembered for his big heart and brute strength; his honor in battle (sparing Seiya) and his heroic last stand (dying on his feet without yielding) are part of Saint legend.

Gemini Saga – Gold Saint of Gemini (former Pope of Sanctuary)
Power Level/Ranking: Saga is one of the most powerful Gold Saints – “canonically, Saga is the strongest Gold Saint of his generation and the most powerful Saint to have ever served Athena” ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=Canonically%2C Saga is the strongest,they’re been alive for longer)). His Cosmo is immense, and he has a dual personality: one good, one evil. Saga’s might is demonstrated by his feats – he secretly killed Aries Shion (the Pope) in his prime, he nearly defeated all Bronze Saints combined, and even other Gold Saints feared confronting him. His “Galaxian Explosion” is regarded as almost unstoppable. Only extraordinary circumstances (Athena’s intervention, his own inner good, or later the combined force of Bronze Saints with Gold weapons) have stopped Saga. By all measures, Saga ranks at the very top of the Gold hierarchy.

Signature Techniques: Galaxian Explosion – Saga’s ultimate attack, generating a massive burst of Cosmo energy akin to a galactic explosion. It can annihilate opponents and structures; when Saga used it in the Sanctuary arc, it was described as if the “galaxy burst” in his hands ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=Canonically%2C Saga is the strongest,they’re been alive for longer)). Few can withstand it – it took Athena’s shield to protect Seiya’s group from it. Another Dimension – Saga opens a dimensional rift, sending his opponent to another dimension. Seiya and Ikki were nearly trapped permanently by this ([Sea Dragon Kanon | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Dragon_Kanon#:~:text=Image%3A The water level of,the cave)). Demon Emperor Fist (Genrō Maō Ken) – a psychic attack where Saga fires a beam into the back of the victim’s brain, controlling their mind ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=They both have incredible mind,let’s not forget what happened)). Saga used this to manipulate Leo Aiolia (turning him temporarily against Seiya) and even attempted it on Athena (which failed due to the infant Athena’s purity). The Demon Emperor Fist showcases Saga’s mastery of both physical and mental warfare ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=They

Key Story Arcs: Years before the series, Saga’s evil personality took over – he murdered Pope Shion and took Athena (baby Saori) to kill her. Aiolos stopped him, so Saga covered his tracks and became the false “Pope Arles” of Sanctuary. In the Sanctuary arc, Saga (as the Pope) is the final adversary. At the Pope’s Palace, Saga battles the Bronze Saints: even after they’ve defeated 11 Gold Saints, Saga nearly defeats the exhausted Bronze Five. He uses Another Dimension to trap Shiryu, Hyoga, Shun, and Ikki. Only Seiya reaches the Shield of Athena; Saga’s Galaxian Explosion grievously wounds Seiya ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=Canonically%2C Saga is the strongest,they’re been alive for longer)). When Saga is about to finish Seiya, Phoenix Ikki intervenes and fights Saga one-on-one. Saga’s power is so overwhelming that Ikki, even withstanding Galaxian Explosion, is on the brink of defeat. Ultimately, Athena awakens (Saori arrives) and Saga’s good side resurfaces in remorse. Saga attempts suicide: he stabs himself with Athena’s golden staff/dagger to atone ([Sea Dragon Kanon | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Dragon_Kanon#:~:text=At first%2C Kanon was depicted,much like his deceased brother)). After Athena’s forgiveness, Saga dies in her arms, ending the Sanctuary rebellion.

However, Saga’s story continues: in the Poseidon arc (anime only), Athena resurrects Saga’s soul along with Camus and Shura to atone. They wear their Gold Cloths and destroy Poseidon’s Main Pillar by sacrificing their Cosmo/lives (this is anime-only and not in manga canon). In the Hades arc, Hades resurrects Saga as a Specter for 12 hours. Saga, Camus, and Shura invade Sanctuary (still wearing their Gold Cloths, but with Surplice insignia). Saga confronts Mu and later Virgo Shaka in a legendary clash in the “Twin Sala” garden. Saga, Camus, Shura vs. Shaka results in Shaka’s near-death (via Athena Exclamation). Saga sheds tears as Shaka “dies,” showing his conflict. Reaching Athena, Saga shockingly kills Athena (Saori) by impaling her with a golden dagger – but this is part of Athena’s plan (she needed to die to go to the Underworld). After Athena’s departure, King Hades’s power tries to punish the traitorous Gold Saints. When Rhadamanthys attacks at Pandemonium, Saga is still immensely powerful; he fights the Judge but under a severe handicap (Hades’s barrier). Ultimately, Saga and his fellow Gold Saints sacrifice themselves at Hades’s Wailing Wall – uniting with the other 9 Gold Saints to unleash their Cosmo and break open the path to Elysion ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=During his first run,Explosion to destroy them both)). Saga leads the prayer, redeeming himself fully.

Final Outcome: Saga truly dies after the Wall of Lament is destroyed. His final act is one of pure loyalty to Athena, erasing all past sins. In Soul of Gold, Saga’s spirit revives in Asgard, and he attains the God Cloth of Gemini to battle Loki – a further chance at redemption he embraces (facing another “evil god” with righteous resolve). Afterward, he passes on peacefully. In Next Dimension, the Gemini Gold Cloth is taken up by new warriors (Gemini Cain/Abel in the 18th century, and Gemini Kanon filled Saga’s role in the late 20th). Saga’s legacy is that of the tragic hero: a man of two halves, whose evil side nearly doomed Athena’s world, but whose good side ultimately saved it. Among Saints, Saga remains a legend – revered for his power, feared for his darkness, and respected for his atonement.

Gemini Kanon – Gold Saint of Gemini (formerly Sea Dragon General)
Power Level/Ranking: Kanon is Saga’s twin brother, equal in potential. Though not a Gold Saint during most of the story, he proves himself Saga’s match. After renouncing his past as Poseidon’s Sea Dragon, Kanon becomes the Gemini Gold Saint in Hades’s war. By then, “Kanon is way stronger than Saga…having trained and fought while Saga was dead” ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=between canon and “realism”,Kanon didn’t get stronger during)). Kanon single-handedly defeats numerous Specters and goes toe-to-toe with Rhadamanthys, showcasing power on par with the top Gold Saints. Essentially, Kanon inherits Saga’s title as the most powerful Saint once he dons Gemini.

Signature Techniques: As Gemini Gold Saint, Kanon can use Galaxian Explosion and Another Dimension similarly to Saga (he demonstrates Galaxian Explosion in Hades arc effectively). He may also know the Demon Emperor Fist, but he’s never shown using it – likely out of disinterest in controlling minds after his redemption. As Sea Dragon Kanon, his move was Golden Triangle, creating a Bermuda Triangle dimensional prison ([Respect Sea Dragon/Gemini Kanon (Saint Seiya: Manga Canon)](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/kw0k7f/respect_sea_dragongemini_kanon_saint_seiya_manga/#:~:text=Respect Sea Dragon%2FGemini Kanon ,his enemy there for eternity)). After taking up Gemini, Kanon uses more direct power; for example, he kills multiple Specters at once with broad Cosmo blasts. Notably, Kanon’s Cosmo was able to kill Specters that even Gold Saints like Milo struggled with, indicating his might.

*Key Story Arcs:

Years before: Kanon was initially as vicious as Saga’s dark side. He attempted to persuade Saga to seize power. Saga imprisoned Kanon in Cape Sounion. There, Kanon discovered Poseidon’s underwater temple and awakened Poseidon’s soul ([Sea Dragon Kanon | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Dragon_Kanon#:~:text=At first%2C Kanon was depicted,much like his deceased brother)) ([Sea Dragon Kanon | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Dragon_Kanon#:~:text=Kanon was the one person,honor of a Gold Saint)). Assuming the identity Sea Dragon, he commanded Poseidon’s army (see Marina Generals section). After Poseidon’s defeat, Kanon is forgiven by Athena and given a chance to fight for redemption ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=out of action,the Seas is sealed again)). In the Hades arc, Kanon returns to Sanctuary bearing the Gemini Gold Cloth (left behind by Saga). Most Gold Saints distrust him, but Athena and Milo test and accept him ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)). Kanon plays a heroic role: He tricks Rhadamanthys by leading 8 Specters to invade the Coliseum then wiping them out in one move (revealing his loyalty). He then travels to Hades’s Inferno. In Cocytus, Kanon confronts Wyvern Rhadamanthys – a grudge match. Kanon initially dominates: he defeats Rhadamanthys’s subordinates and heavily injures the Wyvern. But as Rhadamanthys prepares a finishing blow, Kanon chooses to sacrifice himself to eliminate the Judge. With a fierce grip, Kanon holds Rhadamanthys in place and unleashes Galaxian Explosion at point-blank range, annihilating them both ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=During his first run,Explosion to destroy them both)). This selfless act clears the path for the Bronze Saints. Kanon’s final words are thoughts of Athena’s forgiveness and Saga. Final Outcome: Kanon dies in the Underworld, fully redeemed as a Gold Saint who gave his life. Athena posthumously recognizes Kanon as one of the 12 Gold Saints (Milo even called Kanon “the 13th Gold Saint” as a welcome ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon))). In Soul of Gold, Kanon does not appear (likely his soul passed on peacefully, having no unfinished business). Kanon’s legacy is closely tied to Saga’s – he proved that he could overcome his evil past and become a true Saint of Athena. In the end, Kanon fulfilled the role Saga could not: serving Athena without the shadow of evil. Athena honors Kanon alongside the other Gold Saints who fell breaking the Wailing Wall.
Cancer Deathmask – Gold Saint of Cancer
Power Level/Ranking: Deathmask is the Cancer Gold Saint, infamous for his cruelty. He is formidable in his own right – his psychokinetic techniques related to souls are very dangerous. However, among Gold Saints, Deathmask is often portrayed as one of the “weaker” ones because his lack of honor undermines him (the Virgo Shaka quote “A man who’s abandoned Athena’s love is not worthy of a Gold Cloth” rings true for Deathmask). He was defeated by Shiryu (a Bronze) when Shiryu’s Cosmo of justice outshone Deathmask’s malice. That said, Deathmask easily overpowered Shiryu early in their fight and only lost when Shiryu’s Cosmo was boosted by righteous fury and Athena’s cosmos. In Hades, Deathmask again falls quickly. So while undoubtedly a powerful Gold Saint, Deathmask ranks low among the twelve in mastery (his arrogance and evil gave others openings). Signature Techniques: Sekishiki Meikai-Ha (Accumulated Spirits Dark Wave) – Deathmask’s primary attack. With a swirl of Cosmo and a hand gesture, he drags the souls of his opponents to Yomotsu Hirasaka, the border between Earth and Underworld ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)). This technique effectively transports the target (body and soul) to the Hell entrance. He attempted this on Shiryu, sending Shiryu’s soul toward hell – but Shiryu’s will (and support from Athena/Shunrei’s prayer) brought him back. Sekishiki Kisōen – anime-only named move: Deathmask sends a fiery blast of screaming souls. Deathmask is also adept at standard punches/kicks, and he can fight bare-handed well. Another hallmark is that his Cancer Temple is adorned with the faces of people he killed (imprinted on the walls of his Temple and on his surplice), reflecting his gruesome hobby. Key Story Arcs: In the Sanctuary arc, Deathmask guards Cancer Temple. He battles Dragon Shiryu fiercely. He actually drags Shiryu and Shiryu’s fiancée Shunrei’s soul to the edge of hell (the Yomotsu pit). When Shiryu hears Shunrei’s prayer and Athena’s Cosmo, his Cosmo of justice spikes. Deathmask’s Cancer Cloth abandons him mid-fight because Deathmask’s evil made him unworthy ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=the Pope in the,supposed to be Buddha's reincarnation)). Clothless, Deathmask is helpless as Shiryu, burning with righteous Cosmo, punches him into the Yomotsu pit. Deathmask falls to his demise, screaming in disbelief as he disintegrates. In the Hades arc, Deathmask’s soul is revived by Hades. He and Aphrodite sneak into Sanctuary. They confront Mu at Aries Temple but Mu pulverizes Deathmask with Starlight Extinction almost instantly ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Hades led him to question,the force of a typhoon)). Deathmask’s soul is extinguished (he and Aphrodite were the first two dead among the revived). However, his spirit later joins the collective Gold Saints to destroy the Wall (Athena’s forgiveness extends to even him at that moment). Final Outcome: Deathmask truly dies in the Hades chapter. In Soul of Gold, Deathmask is resurrected in Asgard. This series provides Deathmask a shot at character growth: he initially acts selfishly, but through an unlikely friendship with a kind Asgardian girl, he gains humility. He awakens the Cancer God Cloth and helps defeat Loki’s forces, finally fighting for others rather than personal sadism. After that, he vanishes with a smile, implying he found peace and perhaps redemption. Going forward, the Cancer Gold Cloth in Next Dimension is inherited by a more virtuous Saint (Cancer Izo in the 18th century). Deathmask’s legacy is that of a cautionary tale – a Gold Saint who lost his way. Yet at the very end, even he could feel Athena’s light (as shown by Soul of Gold and the Wall sacrifice). In the annals of Saints, Deathmask is remembered as “the Dark Saint” whose strength was sabotaged by his lack of morals.
Leo Aiolia – Gold Saint of Leo
Power Level/Ranking: Aiolia, Gold Saint of Leo, is one of the most balanced and brave of the Gold Saints. He’s extremely fast and strong, often serving as the Gold Saint who interacts most with Bronze Saints (even training Seiya briefly in the Galaxian Wars manga). Aiolia’s power is demonstrated when under the Pope’s influence, he nearly kills Seiya in seconds – only divine intervention stopped him. In Episode G, Aiolia is the protagonist, fighting Titans and gaining power beyond normal Gold limits. Among his peers, Aiolia is often considered upper-middle in strength; he’s the younger brother of the legendary Aiolos, and many believe he had potential to be as great as Aiolos. Aiolia’s Lightning Plasma technique is one of the fastest barrages among Gold Saints. Signature Techniques: Lightning Plasma – Aiolia’s defining move. He throws a flurry of near lightspeed punches that create literal plasma (ionized air) and hundreds of illusionary “light arrows” that strike the enemy from all directions ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)). The attacks are so many and fast, they appear as countless rays of light. Seiya with a broken leg could barely react to one of these, let alone the full volley ([Pegasus Seiya | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Seiya#:~:text=,His durability is)). Lightning Bolt – a concentrated strike (punch or beam) of lightning Cosmo for a single-target, high-impact hit. Leo’s Play (Lightning Fang) – sometimes depicted in side content, slashing strikes like a lion’s claws. Aiolia’s fighting style is aggressive and straightforward – he overwhelms with speed and force. Key Story Arcs: In the Sanctuary arc, Aiolia is first seen saving Seiya from Silver Saints (in the anime) then later mind-controlled by Pope Saga’s Demon Emperor Fist ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=They both have incredible mind,let’s not forget what happened)). Under this influence, Aiolia fights Seiya at the Leo Temple. He nearly kills Seiya with Lightning Plasma, but Saori’s Cosmo (and Seiya’s new Sagittarius Gold Cloth that briefly appears) frees Aiolia from control. Shocked and remorseful, Aiolia aids Seiya afterward. After Saga’s defeat, Aiolia becomes one of Athena’s most trusted Gold Saints. In the Hades arc, Aiolia plays a major role. He’s part of the “Renegade” Gold Saint three (with Mu and Milo) confronting the reborn Saga, Camus, Shura. Aiolia exchanges blows with Camus and faces Saga’s Galaxian Explosion (surviving thanks to Mu’s shield and his own resilience). Aiolia then joins Mu and Milo in executing an Athena Exclamation against Saga’s team – resulting in a huge explosion that knocks all six Gold Saints out. Post that, Aiolia is one of the last Gold Saints standing in Sanctuary. He is present when Athena departs to the underworld. Later, Aiolia and the other Gold Saints voluntarily commit their lives to break open the Wailing Wall – Aiolia’s Cosmo shines strongly at the moment of sacrifice ([Gold Saints | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Saints#:~:text=When three Gold Saints come,Because of its immense)). Final Outcome: Aiolia dies at the Wall, upholding his brother’s legacy of loyalty. In Soul of Gold, Aiolia is resurrected in Asgard and becomes essentially the lead Gold Saint, much like he was the “main” Gold among Bronzes in earlier arcs. He attains his Leo God Cloth and defeats the God Loki with a powerful Lightning Plasma, avenging his brother Aiolos’s spirit. After that, he returns to rest. The Leo Cloth later finds new owners (Leo Regulus in Lost Canvas, a young prodigy; Leo Kaiser or Mycenae in Omega). Aiolia’s legacy is forever tied to Aiolos’s: living in his brother’s shadow, Aiolia proved himself by heroically giving his life for Athena as well. Known for his courage and sense of justice, Aiolia is often the Gold Saint fans see as the “face” of the Golds – passionate, strong, and fiercely protective of Athena.
Virgo Shaka – Gold Saint of Virgo
Power Level/Ranking: Shaka is often called “the man closest to God” and is arguably the most powerful Gold Saint in pure Cosmo mastery ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=the Pope in the,supposed to be Buddha's reincarnation)) ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=Shaka alone of all saints,been unusually sensitive to sufferings)). He is the only Gold Saint of the 20th century to have fully realized the Eighth Sense (Arayashiki), enabling him to freely exist in the Underworld ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=the Signature Techniques: Tenbu Hōrin (Treasure of the Heavens) – Shaka’s ultimate technique. By opening his eyes (Shaka fights with eyes closed to conserve Cosmo), he unleashes an overwhelming force that strips the enemy of their senses one by one ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=All of his techniques are,dying%2C could escape from that)). It’s essentially unavoidable once invoked; Shaka used it to remove all five senses from Saga, Camus, and Shura, rendering them helpless ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=All Key Story Arcs: In the Sanctuary arc, Shaka is introduced at the Virgo Temple where he battles Ikki. Their fight is monumental: Shaka dominates by removing Ikki’s senses with Tenbu Hōrin ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=All of his techniques are,dying%2C could escape from that)). Ikki chooses self-destruction, and Shaka takes damage but survives (teleporting Ikki away instead of dying). Shaka later revives Ikki’s body and sends him to help at Gemini Temple. After the Sanctuary arc, Shaka is a loyal ally. In the Hades arc, Shaka senses the Specters’ invasion and intercepts Saga, Camus, Shura in the secluded Garden of Twin Salas. In this iconic encounter, Shaka unleashes Tenbu Hōrin and actually has Saga’s group at his mercy ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=All Final Outcome: Shaka’s physical body is gone, but as someone who transcended death, his soul likely returned to Nirvana or was reincarnated. In Next Dimension, Virgo Shijima (18th century) notes Shaka was truly enlightened. The Virgo Gold Cloth passes on (in Omega, a new Virgo Fudou inherits it, also an enlightened type). Shaka’s legacy is profound: he’s seen as the Gold Saint who was almost a deity in power and philosophy. His dedication – sacrificing himself to impart crucial knowledge to Athena – shows his wisdom. Among fans and characters, Shaka stands as the epitome of what a Gold Saint can achieve spiritually and combatively. As Aiolia said, with Shaka’s death “the balance of Sanctuary was shaken”. Nonetheless, Shaka’s final act helped ensure Athena’s victory over Hades, solidifying him as one of Athena’s greatest champions.
Libra Dohko – Gold Saint of Libra
Power Level/Ranking: Libra Dohko (Old Master of Rozan) is a special case: he survived the previous Holy War and spent 243 years in seclusion, maintaining his strength via Misopetha-Menos (the Suspension of Aging) ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=Shaka is one of the,supposed to be Buddha's reincarnation)). In his youth, Dohko was among the mightiest Gold Saints (equal to Aries Shion). In the modern era, he appears as an elderly hermit (his life force slowed to a crawl), but when he releases Misopetha-Menos, he returns to his prime condition. As a Gold Saint, Dohko is extremely powerful and wise – he’s the mentor of Shiryu and has mastered techniques over centuries. Once his true power is unleashed in Hades arc (young form), he’s fully on par with the strongest Gold Saints. Signature Techniques & Weapons: The Libra Gold Cloth comes with 12 weapons (pair of swords, twin spears, twin tonfas (rods), twin nunchaku, twin tridents, and twin shields) ([Eagle Marin | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Marin#:~:text=Eagle Silver Cloth)). As the Libra Saint, Dohko has the authority to distribute these weapons to other Saints when Athena permits (he sent the Libra weapons to Shiryu and friends during Poseidon’s arc via Kiki ([Ophiuchus Shaina | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Ophiuchus_Shaina#:~:text=Shaina invades the Undersea Fortress%2C,of Poseidon to defeat him))). Dohko himself is a master in using them if needed (in Lost Canvas his incarnation uses the swords and staff). Rozan Hyaku Ryuu Ha (Hundred Dragons of Rozan) – Dohko’s ultimate attack, summoning one hundred dragon spirits to strike the enemy. He demonstrated this to Shiryu once (in the manga, Dohko used it in Lost Canvas to wipe out specters). Misopetha-Menos – not an attack, but a technique Athena granted him: Dohko’s heart beats only 100,000 times a year (instead of daily), effectively putting him in suspended animation for over two centuries ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=Shaka is one of the,supposed to be Buddha's reincarnation)). This kept him alive and barely aged so he could guard sealed Hades. Dohko also has immense martial skill, and in his youth his Cosmo was stated to rival Shion’s – they were known as the two survivors of 1747’s war, chosen for Athena’s greatest tasks. Key Story Arcs: For most of the series, Dohko is “Old Master” (Rôshi) at Lushan’s Five Peaks, training Shiryu. He gives guidance telepathically a few times (e.g., advising Shiryu not to unnecessarily sacrifice his life after the 12 Temples). He remains at Rozan during Sanctuary and Poseidon arcs, watching events through the “Stars of Hades” in the sky (108 stars gauge Hades’s seal). In the Hades arc, once those stars vanish (signaling Hades’s revival), Dohko’s duty is done. He releases Misopetha-Menos and regains his youth – transforming from an old man into a muscular young Gold Saint ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=Shaka is one of the,supposed to be Buddha's reincarnation)). Young Dohko summons his Libra Cloth and leaves Mount Rozan for the first time in over 200 years. Arriving at Sanctuary, Dohko confronts the revived Aries Shion (his old friend). Initially they clash – the Earth shakes from their blows as two veterans fight. Ultimately, Shion and Dohko cease hostilities when Shion reveals Athena’s true plan. Reunited, Dohko accompanies Athena’s soul to the Underworld as one of her protectors. At the Wailing Wall, Libra Dohko is one of the 12 Gold Saints who give their lives. Knowing this duty from the start, Dohko smiles and, alongside Shion, leads the chant that destroys the Wall. Final Outcome: Dohko dies content, having fulfilled Athena’s order to survive until the next Holy War and then fight in it. In Next Dimension, Dohko’s spirit still guides Shiryu in some way (Shiryu eventually inherits Libra). Dohko’s Libra Cloth is passed to Genbu (Omega) and later Shiryu. Libra Dohko’s legacy is immense: he was a mentor to a legendary Bronze Saint and a linchpin linking past and present Holy Wars. As one of the two survivors of the previous war, he bore that burden alone on the secluded peaks, showing his patience and loyalty. When the time came, he proved that even after centuries, his “dragon’s fangs” (the Hundred Dragons) were as sharp as ever. Fans remember Dohko as both the jovial old master and the badass youthful warrior – truly embodying the wisdom of Athena over time.
Scorpio Milo – Gold Saint of Scorpio
Power Level/Ranking: Milo is the Gold Saint of Scorpio and a seasoned fighter. He might not be at Saga or Shaka’s cosmic level, but he is clearly among the prominent Gold Saints in combat skill. His Scarlet Needle can systematically incapacitate most opponents. Milo showed his strength by defeating Hyoga (when Hyoga was exhausted) and nearly killing Kanon during a “test” ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)). Milo’s reflexes and power are high – he was fully equal to Aiolia and Mu when they combined forces. One could rank him in the middle among Gold Saints. He’s often the one dealing finishing blows (e.g., to rebellious Specters). Signature Techniques: Scarlet Needle – Milo’s signature technique, a sequence of 15 stings he delivers usually with his right index finger (extended like a scorpion’s stinger). Each “Needle” strike hits a critical point, causing intense pain. Milo typically counts them off with star names. The 15th strike, Antares, is fatal ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)). The Scarlet Needle causes the opponent to bleed from 15 points (the places correspond to the constellation of Scorpio). The progression of strikes can paralyze limbs, induce excruciating pain, and ultimately stop the heart at Antares. Milo sometimes uses an accelerated version Scarlet Needle: Katakaio (all needles at once, in the games/anime). Antares – Milo’s final blow (the brightest star of Scorpio); it’s the coup de grâce Needle to the heart, which he usually saves for last. In addition to Scarlet Needle, Milo is adept in melee; his kicks crushed Seiya’s Nebula Chain attempt and he fought hand-to-hand with Kanon and Hyoga effectively. Key Story Arcs: In the 12 Temples, Scorpio Milo faces Cygnus Hyoga at Scorpio Temple. Hyoga had already been battered by Camus’s training and Aquarius Temple, so Milo easily subdues him. He hits Hyoga with 14 Scarlet Needles, putting Hyoga in near-death agony ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)). Before delivering Antares, Milo realizes Hyoga’s determination (and the intervention of Hyoga’s master Camus’s spirit through freezing Milo’s finger). Acknowledging Hyoga’s Cosmo and to honor Camus’s sacrifice, Milo stops at 14 needles and spares Hyoga – he even uses Antares to heal Hyoga by hitting a non-lethal point, proving Milo’s control. After Sanctuary, Milo remains a loyal, if proud, Saint. In the Hades arc, Milo is one of the active defenders. He, Aiolia, and Mu confront the traitor Golds. Milo exchanges Scarlet Needle with Camus’s ice – but he cannot bring himself to kill Camus (due to their friendship). Milo later tests Kanon at Athena’s request: he greets Kanon with 14 Scarlet Needles in succession ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys Final Outcome: Milo dies with his brethren, a proud Saint till the end. In Soul of Gold, Milo resurrects in Asgard and initially confronts Camus (resentful for Camus’s actions under Hades). Eventually, they reconcile, and Milo attains the Scorpio God Cloth, unleashing an ultimate Antares attack on Loki. He vanishes, content that he fought with honor. The Scorpio Cloth later passes to others (Sonia in Omega for a short time, then lost). Milo’s legacy is highlighted by his character growth: from a slightly arrogant warrior ready to kill Hyoga, to a wiser Saint who can sense when to show mercy (as he did for Hyoga and Kanon). Among Gold Saints, Milo is remembered for his deadly Scarlet Needle technique – a methodical yet compassionate executioner who ultimately always acts in Athena’s interest.
Sagittarius Aiolos – Gold Saint of Sagittarius
Power Level/Ranking: Aiolos (Aioros) is often spoken of with reverence by other characters. He died young (at age 14 in the manga, early 20s in anime) but was considered Pope Shion’s likely successor and “the most noble and one of the strongest Gold Saints” of his time. While we see little of Aiolos in battle (only flashbacks), Saga acknowledges Aiolos was stronger than him in the past (Saga’s evil side waited until Aiolos was out of Sanctuary to attempt his coup) ([Gold Saints Power Ranked | Mornië Utulië](https://elencelebrindal.tumblr.com/post/620967648666304512/gold-saints-power-ranked#:~:text=He wasn’t the strongest Gold,that 5 minutes%2C I believe)). Aiolos’s Cosmo was immense – he single-handedly fought off Shura while badly injured, and in spiritual form aided Seiya. It’s often implied that if Aiolos had lived, he and Saga’s conflict might have gone differently. Overall, Aiolos is placed at the top tier in reputation, if not direct feats. Signature Techniques: Golden Arrow – as Sagittarius, Aiolos’s Cloth includes a bow and arrow. Aiolos’s technique is to fire an arrow charged with his Cosmo. We see this when Aiolos’s spirit guides the Sagittarius Gold Cloth to shoot an arrow at Poseidon’s pillar (anime) and when Seiya in Sagittarius Cloth uses Aiolos’s arrow to strike Hades. Lightning Kick – in some sources, Aiolos uses swift kicks as his melee attack (like how Aiolia uses fists). Generally, Aiolos’s style isn’t deeply shown; his signature is more about accuracy and overwhelming Cosmo focus in that single arrow. The Sagittarius arrow is symbolic: Aiolos used a golden arrow to save Athena (killing servants chasing him, presumably). The arrow’s power is great enough that, in the 12 Temples, only Athena’s shield could stop the one Saga redirected at Seiya. Key Story Arcs: Aiolos’s story occurs mostly in flashback. 13 years before the main story, Aiolos discovers the infant Athena being attacked by the evil Pope (Saga). Aiolos saves the baby and flees Sanctuary, fighting off Capricorn Shura in the process ([Julian Solo | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Julian_Solo#:~:text=This time%2C Poseidon was awakened,is a fan of series)). He’s mortally wounded protecting Athena from Sanctuary’s forces, but he manages to reach a safe place and entrust baby Athena and the Sagittarius Cloth to Mitsumasa Kido ([Julian Solo | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Julian_Solo#:~:text=found its DivineTrident ,is a fan of series)). Aiolos succumbs to his injuries, but his heroism is revealed a decade later when Saori and the Bronze Saints learn the truth. In the Galaxian Wars arc, it’s Aiolos’s Cloth that becomes the tournament prize (and later Saga’s target). In the 12 Temples arc, Aiolos’s presence is felt spiritually: Seiya dons the Sagittarius Gold Cloth against Gemini Saga. In a climactic moment, Aiolos’s spirit seems to guide his arrow, which – combined with Seiya’s Cosmo – strikes Saga (anime version) or helps destroy the evil Saga’s Pope throne. Throughout the series, characters (especially Aiolia) recall Aiolos as the perfect Saint. By the end of Sanctuary, Aiolos’s name is cleared; Athena even dedicates a statue to him. In Poseidon arc (anime), the Sagittarius Cloth (with presumably Aiolos’s will) protects Athena’s pillar and fires an arrow with Seiya to help seal Poseidon. In Hades arc, the ghost of Aiolos, alongside the other Gold Saints, sends his Cloth to the Bronze Saints in Elysion ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=In 1990%2C the Bronze Saints,18th century%2C Dohko and Shion)), showing Aiolos still watches over them. Final Outcome: Aiolos died before the series, but his will influences events long after. His legacy: he is remembered as the epitome of what a Saint should be – courageous, loyal, and self-sacrificing. His younger brother Aiolia lives trying to live up to Aiolos’s example. In Next Dimension, Aiolos’s spirit briefly appears encouraging the Bronze Saints. He’s effectively canonized among Saints; at Sanctuary, Aiolos is honored as a true Saint of Athena posthumously. Had he lived, he likely would have been Pope. After the Holy Wars, the Sagittarius Cloth sees new wielders (Seiya becomes the next Sagittarius Gold Saint in some continuities like Omega, living out Aiolos’s legacy). Aiolos’s title as “Athena’s greatest saint” remains unchallenged in the hearts of those who knew his story ([Virgo Shaka | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Virgo_Shaka#:~:text=the Pope in the,supposed to be Buddha's reincarnation)).
Capricorn Shura – Gold Saint of Capricorn
Power Level/Ranking: Shura, Gold Saint of Capricorn, is the master of the “holy sword” Excalibur. He is portrayed as very powerful at close range – his strikes can cut through almost anything. Shura believed himself to be “Athena’s strongest sword” and indeed killed Aiolos (albeit when Aiolos was already injured). In the 12 Temples, Shura nearly killed Shiryu, one of the toughest Bronzes. Among Gold Saints, Shura is probably mid-tier; his offensive power is very high (Excalibur is deadly), but he was outmatched by dragons of Rozan (Shiryu with Seventh Sense) due to Shura’s underestimation and eventual change of heart. Still, in raw skill, Shura is extremely formidable – he contended with Saga and Camus simultaneously using Athena Exclamation later. His Cosmo is strong and his loyalty (at first misplaced to the Pope) unwavering. Signature Techniques: Excalibur – Shura’s Cosmo manifests as an invisible blade extending from his limbs (typically right arm, but also both arms and legs). With a swipe, he can slice through opponents and objects at a molecular level. Excalibur is named after King Arthur’s sword – Shura claims his right arm is Excalibur. He used it to cut off Aiolos’s leg and mortally wound him years ago. In his fight with Shiryu, Shura’s hand-chops and kicks with Excalibur easily sliced through Shiryu’s Shield and Dragon cloth parts. After Shura’s death, the power of Excalibur passed to Shiryu’s arm ([Dragon Shiryu Profile - Angelfire](https://www.angelfire.com/ca/cavalieri/shiryu.html#:~:text=Dragon Shiryu Profile ,Rozan Dragon Flight)). Jumping Stone – in Episode G, Shura uses a move where he leaps and crashes down on enemies. Generally, Shura fights with kicks and chops augmented by Excalibur’s cutting edge. He’s also mastered physical combat, throwing fast punches and being agile (he dodged attacks from Aiolos’s arrow in flashback). *Key Story Ar*(The analysis continues due to the depth of the Saint Seiya franchise. Given the length, remaining sections are summarized with focus on key highlights.)
Capricorn Shura (continued)
Key Story Arcs: Shura battles Dragon Shiryu at the Capricorn Temple. Initially dominant, he cuts through Shiryu’s defenses with Excalibur. In the end, Shiryu sacrifices himself to defeat Shura: he grabs Shura and executes the Last Dragon (launching both into space). Touched by Shiryu’s selflessness, Shura gifts Shiryu his Excalibur power before dying, ensuring Shiryu survives. In the Hades arc, Shura is revived as a Specter. He participates in the pivotal fight against Shaka (joining Saga and Camus in using Athena Exclamation). After revealing his loyalty to Athena, Shura perishes at the Wailing Wall with the other Gold Saints. His redemption is complete – he asks Athena’s forgiveness for killing Aiolos and dies a hero.
Aquarius Camus
Key Points: Camus, Gold Saint of Aquarius, is Hyoga’s master and absolute zero expert. He duels Hyoga at Aquarius Temple, pushing Hyoga to awaken the Seventh Sense. Hyoga defeats Camus by reaching absolute zero, and Camus dies proud of his student. Revived in the Hades arc, Camus aids Saga and Shura in Athena’s Exclamation, then sacrifices himself at the Wailing Wall. Camus’s legacy lives through Hyoga (who inherits the Aquarius Cloth in later sequels).
Pisces Aphrodite
Key Points: Aphrodite, Gold Saint of Pisces, uses poisonous roses. He kills Andromeda Shun’s mentor, showing his cruelty. At Pisces Temple, Shun unleashes Nebula Storm to defeat Aphrodite, who dies but manages to fatally wound Shun with a Bloody Rose. Revived briefly in Hades arc, Aphrodite is dispatched by Mu swiftly ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)). Despite his beauty and deadly powers, he’s seen as one of the “weaker” Gold Saints due to his quick defeats. He dies permanently at the Wall with others. (Note: The above covers Athena’s Saints. Below are the factions for Poseidon, Hades, and Asgard.)
Poseidon’s Marina Generals (Scales)
Poseidon’s army consists of Marina Generals who wear Scales – armors corresponding to sea guardian deities (Seven Seas). Each General is roughly Gold Saint-level in strength. They guard the seven pillars sustaining the oceans. Major Generals include:
Sea Dragon Kanon – North Atlantic General (disguised mastermind). (Discussed above under Gemini Kanon.) Kanon orchestrated the Poseidon war and later turned good.
Siren Sorrento – South Atlantic General. Uses a flute for the Dead End Symphony, a sound-based attack that induces deathly sleep and can **“shatter even Cosmo defenses”* (it shattered Shun’s Nebula Chain). Sorrento defeats Taurus Aldebaran with his melody (anime) and later survives Poseidon’s war, even helping Athena in Next Dimension.
Dragon Sea General Isaac (Kraken) – Arctic Ocean General. A childhood friend of Hyoga turned Poseidon’s warrior. Uses Aurora Borealis ice attacks similar to Hyoga’s, but Hyoga defeats him, reconciling their past.
Sea Horse Baian – North Pacific General. Fights Pegasus Seiya first in Poseidon’s arc. Uses God Breath (tornado-like blasts) and strong defense. Seiya unlocks more Cosmo to beat him.
Lyumnades Kasa – South Pacific General. A shapeshifter who uses illusions of loved ones to lower opponents’ guard. Kasa kills Unicorn Jabu (in manga side story) and almost defeats Shun by appearing as Ikki. Ultimately, Ikki kills Kasa, seeing through the illusion with raw power.
Scylla Io – Indian Ocean General. Has six “Beast” attacks (Eagle, Wolf, Queen Bee, Serpent, Vampire Bat, Bear), each with unique power. Andromeda Shun deduces each weakness and defeats Io with Nebula Storm.
Chrysaor Krishna – Indian Ocean General (in anime, the Pacific pillar was moved, so Krishna is technically Pacific in manga). Wields a golden lance Spear of Chrysaor that can emit energy slashes. Dragon Shiryu breaks Krishna’s spear using the ascending dragon and Libra shield, then wins by invoking Excalibur (gifted from Shura).
Poseidon himself inhabits the body of Julian Solo, wearing the Poseidon Scale with the trident as a weapon. Poseidon’s power far exceeds his Generals – it took Athena’s intervention to seal him. Final Outcomes: All pillars were destroyed by Bronze Saints wearing Gold Cloths or with extreme Cosmo. Most Generals were defeated (some died, like Io and Kasa; others like Sorrento survive and retreat). Poseidon is sealed in Athena’s amphora again. Notably, Sorrento survives and appears in Next Dimension, guiding Julian Solo to aid Athena (implying he turned good). Kanon reforms and leaves Poseidon’s service to become a Gold Saint. Poseidon (Julian Solo) awakens briefly in Next Dimension but remains largely sealed. After the war, the ocean returns to normal with Poseidon’s threat neutralized.
Hades’s Specters (Surplices)
Hades commands 108 Specters (evil stars), each with a Surplice armor corresponding to a star in Hades’s constellation. The Specters are divided into 3 ranks: 36 Heavenly Stars (elite), 72 Earthly Stars (lower rank). The top Specters are the 3 Judges of Hell:
Wyvern Rhadamanthys – Celestial Fierce Star, Hades’s most loyal Judge. Power: Among the trio, he’s depicted as the strongest in raw power ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Rhadamanthys is the most powerful,the force of a typhoon)). In Hades’s castle (with a protective barrier), he easily defeats Gold Saints Aiolia, Milo, and Mu (who were at 1/10th power) ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=a typhoon)). His signature move Greatest Caution is a massive shockwave/air-pressure blast, like a super-typhoon, that can crush opponents (it’s said to “destroy nearly any enemy” and even “crush stars” in Taizen guides). Rhadamanthys personally kills or defeats multiple Saints (he sent Orphée to his death, defeated Kanon when Kanon was exhausted, and killed many Bronze Saints in Cocytus). Final Fate: Rhadamanthys is taken down when Kanon, at full power, drags him into a suicide Galaxian Explosion ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=During his first run,Explosion to destroy them both)). In anime, Hyoga and Shiryu finish him after he mortally wounds Kanon. He dies at the literal gate of Elysion, cursing Athena.
Griffin Minos – Celestial Noble Star, Judge of the 2nd Prison. Power: Minos uses Cosmic Marionettion, an ability to telekinetically control an opponent’s body like a puppet by invisible strings. He nearly kills Kanon with it until Ikki intervenes. Minos also faces Bronze Saints in Elysion: Shiryu and Hyoga team up to fight him. They manage to break his technique (Shiryu cuts the “strings” with Excalibur) and overwhelm him with a combined attack. Final Fate: Minos is defeated by Hyoga & Shiryu in Hell’s freezing circles (in manga he’s defeated by Kanon’s trap earlier).
Garuda Aiacos – Celestial Valiant Star, Judge of 5th Prison. Power: Aiacos is hot-headed but strong. Uses Galactica Illusion, creating a vortex of energy, and Garuda Flap (wind blasts). He battles Phoenix Ikki in Cocytus. Though Aiacos initially gains upper hand using a fake “Demon Illusion Punch” on Ikki, Phoenix revives and completely thrashes Aiacos – Ikki’s Phoenix Illusion Fist and his sheer strength cause Aiacos to collapse. Ikki finishes him with a fiery punch. Final Fate: Aiacos is killed by Ikki ([Tenmōsei, Wyvern Rhadamanthys (Character) - Comic Vine ](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rhadamanthys-of-wyvern/4005-56090/#:~:text=Leo Aiolia%2C Aries Mu%2C and,and buried him in Cocytus)). (In anime, Ikki blasts him into a fiery volcano in the Giudecca palace.)
Other notable Specters:
Pandora – Not a Specter per se, but Hades’s high-ranking attendant (wearing a dress, not surplice). She commands the Specters until Hades awakens fully. She is human (Hades’s distant relative) and wields a lethal trident and harp. Pandora ultimately turns against Hades upon learning he possessed her brother Alone.
Papillon Myu – A Specter who fights Shiryu: he evolves from a cocoon to a butterfly. Shiryu defeats him with Rising Dragon.
Minotauros Gordon, Basilisk Sylphid, Harpy Valentine – these Specters are Rhadamanthys’s subordinates who battle Ikki and Kanon. They fall to Kanon’s Galaxian Explosion.
Sphinx Pharaoh – uses a Balance of Curse (a scale judging a person’s sins). Orphée defeats him with an attack (Pharaoh tricked Orphée in the past).
Lycaon Phlegyas – Ferryman Specter, defeated by Hyoga at the Wailing Wall.
Standouts in Lost Canvas: Celestial Fierce Star Wyvern Rhadamanthys (a different incarnation, extremely powerful, killed numerous Gold Saints until Tenma and Sasha defeated him together), Celestial Cruelty Oneiros (a dream god fought in Saint Seiya: Omega or Lost Canvas Gaiden), etc.
Hades (God of Underworld): The ultimate “armor” is Hades’s own God Hades Surplice worn by his host (Alone in Lost Canvas, Shun temporarily in original). Hades’s power is divine, far beyond any Saint. In the 20th century, Hades’s soul leaves Shun’s body to manifest. Hades wields a sword that cursed Seiya. It takes the combined Cosmo of all Bronze Saints in God Cloths, plus Athena with her Cloth to defeat Hades. Hades dies when Athena strikes him with her Nike staff, after Seiya and Ikki shatter his physical body. Final Outcomes (Hades arc): All Specters are defeated. Many are killed by Gold Saints sacrificing themselves (Shion wiped out a number with Athena Exclamation, etc.), while others fall to Bronze Saints. The 108 Specter souls are re-sealed when Hades is destroyed. Pandora is spared by Athena. After Hades’s death, the Underworld collapses, and any remaining Specters perish. The Gold Saints, having sacrificed themselves, do not return (except via Soul of Gold non-canon). The Bronze Saints (especially Ikki and Shiryu) carry on some Specter powers indirectly (Shiryu retains Excalibur from Shura; Ikki’s Phoenix ensures he can survive Hell). Essentially, Athena’s Saints end Hades’s cycle of revival, freeing earth from the 250-year curse.
Odin’s God Warriors (God Robes of Asgard)
(Asgard is an anime-only arc in the original series but an important part of franchise lore, plus Soul of Gold expands on Asgard.) In the Asgard arc (anime), the antagonists are the God Warriors of Odin, each wearing a God Robe (armors representing Norse constellations, infused with Odin’s power). They serve Hilda of Polaris (Odin’s priestess who is mind-controlled by Poseidon via the Nibelung Ring). The God Warriors, while not canonical to Kurumada’s manga, are comparable to Silver or Gold Saints in strength. Key God Warriors:
Dubhe Siegfried – God Warrior of Alpha (Dubhe, representing Odin’s dragon). Strongest God Warrior, analogous to Siegfried from myth (invulnerable except one weak point). He fights Phoenix Ikki; it takes Ikki exploiting his weakness (his heart) to win. Siegfried sacrifices himself to drag Poseidon’s soul out of Hilda’s palace, dying honorably.
Alpha Merak Hagen – Beta God Warrior. Childhood friend of Hyoga’s love interest Freya. Uses fire and ice attacks (powerful because he’s immune to both). Battles Hyoga in a volcano; Hyoga wins by outsmarting him (cooling his armor then shattering it). Hagen perishes in lava.
Gamma Phecda Thor – Giant warrior, immense strength with a hammer and throwing axes. Shiryu defeats Thor by focusing Cosmo into a single blow.
Delta Megrez Alberich – scheming warrior who traps saints in Amethyst Shields (crystals). He outwits several Bronze Saints, capturing Marin and nearly Seiya. Seiya breaks free; Shiryu (with a telepathic hint from Mu) uses Excalibur to cut Alberich’s amethyst and defeat him.
Epsilon Alioth Fenrir – feral warrior raised by wolves. Fights Shun with ferocious attacks (Wolf Cruelty Claw). Shun’s gentleness initially loses ground, but ultimately Shun’s Nebula Storm overpowers Fenrir, who is then ironically buried by an avalanche alongside his wolf pack.
Zeta Mizar Syd & Eta Alioth Bud – twin God Warriors (one in shadow). Syd fights Ikki and Shun, is defeated when Ikki discerns that Bud (his twin) is interfering. Ikki helps reconcile them briefly; Bud disappears after Syd dies in his arms.
Benetnasch Eta Mime (in manga spin-off only) – Actually part of “God Warriors” in Episode G Assassin (different continuity), but in anime Asgard, Bud fills Eta role.
After defeating the God Warriors, Seiya uses Odin’s sword (from Odin Robe that they obtain with help of Asgardians) to break the Nibelung Ring and free Hilda. The God Warriors mostly die, except maybe Bud and Fenrir’s fate is ambiguous. In Soul of Gold, the 12 Gold Saints are resurrected in Asgard by the evil god Loki. They fight new God Warriors who wield “Sacred Treasures” of Yggdrasil. Eventually, Gold Saints don God Cloths and defeat Loki, saving Asgard again. Gold Saints vanish thereafter. Final Outcome: Asgard is saved, Hilda returns to benevolence. The God Warriors’ threat ends. Asgard remains an ally of Athena (Hilda and Asgardians aid in later series like Omega). Odin’s God Robe (worn by Seiya briefly) goes back to Odin’s shrine. Loki is sealed by Gold Saints in Soul of Gold.
Other Notable Armor Classes
Steel Saints – Sanctuary-made armored suits (not Cosmo-based Cloths) given to three youths (Sho, Daichi, Ushio in anime) to assist Bronze Saints. They lack Cosmo powers akin to true Saints and are anime-only. Eventually, they retire from battle, their suits destroyed protecting Athena.
Saintia (Female Saints) – The Saintia Shō spin-off introduces Saintias: female Saints who serve as Athena’s personal maidens (exempt from the mask rule). The lead, Equuleus Shoko, wears a Bronze Cloth (Equuleus) and fights the evil goddess Eris. The Saintias (Shoko, Mii, Xiaoling, Katya, Elda) battle Eris’s Dryads to protect Athena during Sanctuary arc. They succeed in sealing Eris. Their fate: they survive and continue serving Saori.
Next Dimension Characters – In Athena’s past (18th century), new Gold Saints appear: e.g., Ophiuchus Odysseus, the legendary 13th Gold Saint who is resurrected (wearing the Ophiuchus Gold Cloth). He is said to rival gods, posing a new threat in Next Dimension ([Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Seiya:_Next_Dimension#:~:text=resurrection of the 13th Gold,0)). This is ongoing storyline.
Omega’s Elemental Cloths – In Saint Seiya Omega, Saints’ Cloths evolve with elemental powers and “Omega” Cosmo. Kouga (Pegasus) and friends fight Mars (a deity) and later Pallas/Saturn. New classes: Pallasites (Chronotector armors), ranking Primary (strongest) to Tertiary. Legendary Saints (Seiya, etc.) also appear in Omega as Gold Saints or legendary Bronzes.
Eris’s Dryads – From Saintia Shō, Eris’s followers wear Dryad robes. Not as durable as Cloths; they are defeated by Saintias and Gold Saints easily. Eris herself briefly possesses Kyoko (Equuleus Kyoko) in a corrupted Cloth.
Titans (Episode G) – Gold Saints in Episode G fight Titans (Coeus, Hyperion, etc.) who have Titan’s Surplices and divine Dunamis power. This is a different kind of armor, at times equal to Gold Cloths. Ultimately, Aiolia and Gold Saints seal the Titans again.
Each spin-off adds new armor types, but the core concept remains: Cosmo and the resolve of the wearer determine victories more than the armor material itself.

Conclusion: The Saint Seiya franchise’s armored classes each bring unique characters and powers to the forefront. Bronze Saints rise from underdogs to god-like heroes, Silver Saints display a wide array of specialized techniques (from Marin’s agility to Orphée’s lyre melodies), Gold Saints exemplify the pinnacle of human Cosmo (light-speed and miracles), while Poseidon’s Marinas and Hades’s Specters provide formidable challenges with their divine blessings and dark sorcery. In the end, it’s the unwavering resolve, friendship, and “burning Cosmo” of Athena’s Saints that triumphs over gods and fate, a theme resonating across the original saga and its sequels. Athena’s Saints, clad in Cloths of bronze, silver, or gold, prove that the true power of a armor comes from the spirit of the warrior within ([Pegasus Seiya | Seiyapedia | Fandom](https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasus_Seiya#:~:text=power,To awaken such)).
