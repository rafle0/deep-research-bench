Horizontal Gene Transfer in Eukaryotic Evolution: Exploring Mechanisms and Significance in Plants and Animals
1. Introduction: Horizontal Gene Transfer Beyond Microbes
1.1. Defining Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT)
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), also commonly referred to as lateral gene transfer (LGT), describes the transmission of genetic material, such as DNA or specific genes, between different organisms through mechanisms other than the standard vertical inheritance from parent to offspring.1 This process fundamentally differs from reproduction, allowing genetic information to move across species boundaries, sometimes even between very distantly related organisms.7 The transferred genetic material must be incorporated into the recipient organism's genome to become heritable.3 HGT is now recognized as a significant factor influencing the phenotypes and evolutionary trajectories of many organisms.7

The very definition of HGT sets it apart from the traditional view of evolution proceeding solely through vertical descent and modification. Vertical transmission creates branching patterns of relatedness, often depicted as a phylogenetic tree. HGT, by allowing gene sharing between disparate branches, introduces network-like connections, potentially complicating or even challenging the simple tree model, particularly in organisms where it is frequent.10 This non-vertical movement of genes is a key reason why HGT is considered a potent evolutionary force.

HGT has been most extensively studied and is considered a major evolutionary mechanism in prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea).2 In these domains, it is a primary driver of adaptation and diversification, responsible for the rapid spread of ecologically important traits, including antibiotic resistance, virulence factors in pathogens, and novel metabolic capabilities.1 Alongside mutation, HGT is considered a significant source of the genetic variation upon which natural selection acts in prokaryotes.6

1.2. Contrasting HGT Prevalence: Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes
The prevalence and impact of HGT differ markedly between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, HGT is pervasive, with estimates suggesting that a substantial fraction of genes in many bacterial and archaeal genomes—potentially ranging from 2% to over 80% in some analyses—originated through horizontal transfer.7 The rate of gene gain and loss via HGT in microbes can be comparable to, or even exceed, the rate of point mutations, highlighting its dominance as an evolutionary force in these lineages.26

Conversely, HGT has historically been considered much rarer and of limited evolutionary importance in eukaryotes, particularly in complex multicellular organisms like plants and animals.2 Early genomic studies sometimes dismissed potential eukaryotic HGT events as artifacts or contamination.15

However, this view is evolving rapidly. With the exponential growth of eukaryotic genomic data and improvements in detection methods, accumulating evidence demonstrates that HGT does occur across all major eukaryotic lineages, including plants, animals, fungi, and various protist groups.2 While still quantitatively less frequent than in prokaryotes, eukaryotic HGT is proving to be more widespread and evolutionarily significant than previously appreciated.8

The historical perception of HGT rarity in eukaryotes may stem not only from genuine biological barriers but also from limitations in data availability and the inherent difficulties in detecting such events in complex genomes.2 As these limitations are overcome, the recognized scope and frequency of eukaryotic HGT continue to expand, suggesting that earlier assessments might have significantly underestimated its true extent.

1.3. Significance of Studying HGT in Plants and Animals
Investigating HGT in non-microbial eukaryotes, specifically plants and animals, is crucial for a complete understanding of their evolution, adaptation, and the diversification of life.2 The occurrence of HGT challenges the strictly hierarchical, tree-like representation of eukaryotic evolution, suggesting that network-like or reticulate evolutionary events, involving gene flow between distinct lineages, also contribute to shaping their genomes.10

Furthermore, HGT provides a mechanism for the rapid acquisition of novel biological functions.5 By acquiring pre-evolved genes from other organisms, eukaryotes can potentially gain new metabolic pathways, resistance to environmental stresses (like toxins, drought, or pathogens), or developmental innovations far more quickly than through the gradual processes of mutation and selection acting on existing genes. The relative rarity of HGT in these complex organisms implies that the genes successfully transferred and retained might confer particularly significant adaptive advantages or be under strong positive selection, making their study especially illuminating for understanding key evolutionary transitions and adaptations [User Query].

2. Barriers and Complexity of HGT in Eukaryotes
2.1. Why HGT is Rarer/More Complex in Eukaryotes
Several biological features distinguish eukaryotes, particularly multicellular plants and animals, from prokaryotes, contributing to the lower observed frequency and increased complexity of successful HGT events.3

Germline Sequestration: Perhaps the most significant barrier in sexually reproducing multicellular eukaryotes is the early separation and physical isolation of the germline (cells that produce gametes – sperm and eggs) from the somatic lineage (all other body cells).15 For a horizontally acquired gene to become evolutionarily significant, it must be passed on to subsequent generations. This requires the foreign DNA to not only enter the organism but specifically reach and integrate into the genome of germline cells. Somatic cells, which are more likely to encounter foreign DNA through environmental exposure, infection, or ingestion, typically do not contribute genetic material to offspring. This contrasts sharply with unicellular prokaryotes, where any genetic modification to the cell is directly heritable by its descendants.3 Notably, some eukaryotic groups, like plants and basal animals (sponges, corals), lack such strict early germline sequestration, potentially making them inherently more permeable to HGT.52 Comparative genomic analyses within animals support this, showing a higher incidence of ancient interdomain HGT events predating the evolution of a sequestered germline in Bilateria, compared to transfers occurring after its establishment, even when accounting for sampling differences.52 This suggests germline sequestration is a major, though not entirely impermeable, barrier influencing HGT rates in animals.

Nuclear Compartmentalization: Eukaryotic genetic material is housed within a membrane-bound nucleus, unlike the freely accessible cytoplasmic DNA of prokaryotes.3 This nuclear envelope represents an additional physical barrier that foreign DNA must traverse to reach the chromosomes for potential integration.3

Genome Complexity and Organization: Eukaryotic genomes are typically much larger and more structurally complex than prokaryotic ones. They consist of multiple linear chromosomes packaged into chromatin, a dynamic structure of DNA and proteins that regulates gene accessibility.3 Integrating foreign DNA into this organized structure without causing deleterious disruptions, and ensuring its stable replication along with the host genome, presents a greater challenge compared to the simpler, often circular genomes of prokaryotes.3

Gene Expression Differences: The molecular machinery for gene expression differs substantially between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.45 Eukaryotic genes typically require specific promoter and enhancer sequences for transcription initiation, undergo processing including the removal of introns via splicing, and possess signals for termination and polyadenylation.12 Prokaryotic genes transferred into a eukaryotic host often lack these necessary eukaryotic regulatory signals. Furthermore, prokaryotic genes are generally intronless, or possess different intron types, meaning they might not be correctly expressed or processed by the eukaryotic splicing machinery.45 Even if transcribed and translated, the resulting protein might not fold correctly or function properly within the distinct biochemical environment of the eukaryotic cell. The "complexity hypothesis" further posits that informational genes (those involved in core processes like transcription and translation) are particularly difficult to transfer functionally due to their integration into large, complex molecular systems, making them less compatible with the corresponding systems in a different species compared to operational genes like metabolic enzymes.94

These distinct barriers—germline isolation, nuclear compartmentalization, genome complexity, and divergent expression systems—collectively contribute to the lower frequency of successful, functional HGT observed in multicellular eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes. Each step, from initial DNA entry to stable integration, expression, and eventual fixation in the germline, represents a significant hurdle, making the overall probability of a successful HGT event considerably lower.

2.2. Overcoming the Barriers: Potential "Weak Links" and Opportunities
Despite the formidable barriers, the documented occurrence of HGT in diverse eukaryotes, including complex plants and animals, demonstrates that these obstacles are not insurmountable.45 Specific life history stages, ecological interactions, and biological vectors can create opportunities or "weak links" that facilitate the transfer process.

Life History Stages:

Unicellular Eukaryotes (Protists): Lacking a sequestered germline and often employing phagocytosis (cell eating) for feeding, protists generally exhibit higher rates of HGT compared to multicellular organisms.12 Phagocytosis directly introduces foreign DNA into the cell.12
Early Developmental Stages: In multicellular organisms, early developmental stages, such as eggs or embryos before germline sequestration is complete, may represent vulnerable periods where foreign DNA has a greater chance of entering germline precursor cells.41 Oviparous (egg-laying) species have been specifically suggested as having potential entry points during these stages.48
Intimate Biological Interactions:

Parasitism, Symbiosis, and Epiphytism: Prolonged and close physical contact between different species significantly increases the likelihood of DNA exchange.4 Parasites may act as vectors, transferring genes between hosts or acquiring genes from hosts.8 Parasitic plants, forming direct vascular connections (haustoria) with hosts, show frequent mitochondrial HGT.17 Endosymbionts residing within host cells, especially those associated with germ tissues (like Wolbachia in insects), provide a constant source of potentially transferable DNA.19 Bacteria like Agrobacterium possess specialized secretion systems (T4SS) evolved to inject DNA directly into plant cells.54
Grafting (Plants): The artificial or natural fusion of plant tissues allows direct cell-to-cell contact and has been shown to facilitate the transfer of organelles and potentially nuclear DNA.2
Vectors and Mobile Elements:

Viruses: Viruses can integrate their genomes into host DNA (forming endogenous viral elements) and sometimes package host DNA fragments, potentially acting as vectors for gene transfer between eukaryotic individuals or species.2
Transposable Elements (TEs): These "jumping genes" possess their own enzymatic machinery for movement and integration, making them naturally prone to horizontal transfer between genomes.2 They can act as vectors carrying adjacent host genes along with them.
Other Potential Vectors: Bacteria, fungi, plasmids, and even insects have been proposed as potential vectors or intermediaries in eukaryotic HGT events.2
Environmental Factors:

Stress-Induced DNA Damage: Conditions like extreme desiccation can cause DNA double-strand breaks. It has been hypothesized, particularly for bdelloid rotifers, that the subsequent DNA repair processes might incorporate environmental DNA, facilitating HGT.20 However, the general applicability of this "gateway hypothesis" is debated, as studies comparing desiccation-tolerant and -sensitive organisms haven't found consistent evidence for increased DNA integration.50
These mechanisms often involve specific biological agents (vectors, symbionts, parasites) or life stages that effectively bypass or overcome the general barriers, such as the somatic-germline divide or the nuclear envelope, that would typically prevent random environmental DNA from integrating into a multicellular eukaryote's heritable genome.

3. Documented Cases of HGT in Plants
3.1. Overview
Horizontal gene transfer is increasingly recognized as a factor in plant evolution, with documented cases involving gene flow from bacteria, fungi, viruses, and, most frequently, other plants.2 These transfers have impacted nuclear, mitochondrial, and even plastid genomes. Plant mitochondrial genomes, in particular, appear to be hotspots for HGT, especially involving transfers between different plant species.17 Parasitic plants, which form intimate vascular connections with their hosts, exhibit remarkably high frequencies of mitochondrial gene transfer.17

3.2. Specific Examples
Mitochondrion-to-Mitochondrion Transfers: Numerous instances of HGT involving mitochondrial genes have been reported between different plant species, spanning angiosperms, gymnosperms, and ferns.17 Examples include the transfer of coding regions for essential respiratory chain components (e.g., nad1, nad5, atp1, cox2) and ribosomal proteins (rps2, rps11).17 Transfers have occurred between closely related species (e.g., within Plantago) and across vast phylogenetic distances, such as from mosses to the early-diverging angiosperm Amborella trichopoda, and from angiosperms to the gymnosperm Gnetum.17 Amborella stands out for having acquired numerous copies of mitochondrial genes from multiple donors, primarily other angiosperms and mosses.17 Parasitism is a strongly implicated facilitator, with transfers documented between parasitic plants (Rafflesiaceae, Apodanthaceae, Orobanchaceae) and their hosts or unrelated plants sharing the same environment.17 These transfers can result in chimeric genes, as seen with rps11 in Sanguinaria, which combines vertically inherited and horizontally acquired sequences.17 This high frequency in mitochondria compared to other genomes suggests potentially different DNA repair mechanisms, selective pressures, or opportunities for DNA uptake within this organelle.
Agrobacterium T-DNA Integration: One of the most well-characterized examples of bacteria-to-plant HGT is the natural transfer of Transfer DNA (T-DNA) from soil bacteria of the genus Agrobacterium into the nuclear genomes of host plants.5 This process, mediated by the bacterium's Type IV Secretion System, is the basis for modern plant genetic engineering.54 Natural, heritable T-DNA insertions (termed cellular T-DNA or cT-DNA) have been found in several species within the genera Nicotiana (tobacco) and Linaria (toadflax), likely originating from ancient infections by Agrobacterium rhizogenes.5 These integrated cT-DNAs contain homologs of bacterial genes involved in plant hormone synthesis (rol genes) and opine metabolism (mis gene), and remarkably, these genes are often still expressed in the host plant.5 Similar ancient T-DNA insertions have also been discovered in the genus Ipomoea, including the cultivated sweet potato (I. batatas), making it a naturally occurring genetically modified organism.5 The persistence and expression of these cT-DNA genes suggest they may have conferred selective advantages during the evolution of these plant lineages.5
Transposable Element (TE) Mobility: TEs, or "jumping genes," are mobile genetic elements abundant in plant genomes. Evidence indicates that they can also move horizontally between different plant species.2 Early examples included transfers between distantly related grasses like rice and millet.7 LTR retrotransposons, particularly those belonging to the Copia superfamily (e.g., Ale and Ivana lineages), appear more prone to horizontal transfer between plant species than other TE types.2 While initially thought to be less common than in animals 99, TE-mediated HGT is now recognized as a potentially significant source of genomic variation and innovation in plants.4
Plastid-to-Plastid Transfers: HGT involving the chloroplast (plastid) genome was long considered unlikely or unproven in land plants.53 However, recent research provided the first conclusive evidence for interspecific plastid-to-plastid HGT.53 This involved the transfer of a fragment containing the rpl16 G2 intron from a moss species (Bryum pseudotriquetrum) into the plastid genome of another distantly related moss (Scorpidium cossonii).53 The transfer occurred independently at multiple locations where habitats had been recently disturbed, suggesting that close physical contact between the filamentous protonema stages of the mosses during colonization facilitated the DNA exchange.53 Importantly, only plastid fragments, not entire organelles, were transferred.53 Another potential case involves a chloroplast trnA fragment found in the mitochondrial genome of Phaseolus (bean), possibly acquired via an intermediate plant's mitochondrion.17 These findings challenge the assumption that plastid genomes are strictly vertically inherited.
Genes Conferring Stress Resistance and Novel Functions: Plants have acquired functionally important genes via HGT from microbes, aiding adaptation to diverse environments.41 Genomic surveys have identified numerous candidate genes in various plant phyla (Chlorophyta, Streptophyta) likely acquired from bacteria or archaea that confer resistance to abiotic stresses.77 These include genes involved in tolerance to toxic heavy metals (e.g., ChrA, CopA, CorA), osmotic and drought stress (e.g., Na+/proline symporter, potassium/proton antiporter), low pH (e.g., PcxA, ArcA), temperature extremes (e.g., heat shock proteins like DnaJ, Hsp20; cold shock protein CspA), and oxidative stress.77 Furthermore, HGT events are implicated in key evolutionary transitions, such as the acquisition of genes crucial for terrestrial adaptation in the ancestors of land plants. Examples include a phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) gene, essential for the phenylpropanoid pathway (involved in UV protection, structure, defense), acquired from soil bacteria or fungi 77, and genes enhancing desiccation tolerance (GRAS, PYR/PYL/RCAR) acquired by charophyte algae (Zygnematophyceae, the closest relatives of land plants) from soil bacteria.41 Other examples include aquaglyceroporins and glutathione biosynthesis genes from bacteria 17, and a neochrome gene transferred from hornworts to ferns, enabling photosynthesis in low-light conditions.2 Conversely, plant genes like expansins have been transferred to fungi, enhancing their ability to infect plants.2 These examples underscore HGT's role not just as an evolutionary curiosity but as a potent mechanism for acquiring adaptive traits related to environmental challenges and ecological interactions.

4. Documented Cases of HGT in Animals
4.1. Overview
While historically considered less common than in prokaryotes or even plants, evidence for HGT in animals (Metazoa) is steadily accumulating across diverse phyla.6 Transfers have been documented from bacteria, fungi, plants, viruses, and even between different animal lineages. Invertebrates, particularly groups like rotifers, nematodes, and arthropods, feature prominently in HGT studies, often linked to specific ecological interactions such as endosymbiosis, parasitism, or specialized diets.19 The requirement for integration into the germline remains a significant filter, suggesting that retained HGT events often confer substantial adaptive benefits.49

4.2. Specific Examples
Aphid Carotenoid Biosynthesis: This remains one of the most compelling and well-studied examples of functional HGT in animals.2 Aphids (Hemiptera), such as the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum and the green peach aphid Myzus persicae, possess a suite of genes enabling them to synthesize carotenoid pigments. Phylogenetic analyses strongly indicate these genes (encoding enzymes like geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase, phytoene synthase, and carotenoid desaturase) were acquired via HGT from fungi, likely through consumption.6 This transfer event, unique among animals studied, allows aphids to produce carotenoids like torulene, responsible for their characteristic red or green body color polymorphism.6 This color variation has ecological consequences, influencing susceptibility to predators and potentially conferring differential resistance to insecticides.6 The pathway appears to have been assembled through the coordinated transfer and subsequent duplication of multiple fungal genes within an ancestral aphid lineage.87
Bdelloid Rotifers: Massive HGT and Extremotolerance: Bdelloid rotifers, microscopic freshwater invertebrates known for their ancient asexuality and extreme resistance to desiccation and radiation, exhibit an exceptionally high level of HGT.8 Genomic and transcriptomic studies estimate that roughly 8-10% of their active genes are derived from non-metazoan sources, including bacteria, fungi, and plants.20 These foreign genes are often clustered in subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes 78 and encode a wide array of functions, notably enzymes involved in metabolism (e.g., glycosyl hydrolases for degrading complex carbohydrates, β-galactosidase potentially aiding digestion of algae/bacteria), detoxification, and antioxidant biosynthesis.20 Many of these acquired genes are transcribed and functional.20 It is hypothesized that this massive influx of foreign genes provides genetic variation, potentially compensating for the lack of sexual recombination, and may contribute to their remarkable stress tolerance.20 The proposed mechanism involves the repair of DNA double-strand breaks induced during desiccation/rehydration cycles, which might facilitate the uptake and integration of foreign DNA present in their environment (e.g., from ingested food particles).20 Recent work shows hundreds of these horizontally acquired genes are specifically upregulated in response to infection by a natural fungal pathogen, suggesting a role in immunity.90
Tardigrades ("Water Bears"): A Case of Contamination Controversy: Tardigrades, another group of microscopic invertebrates famed for their resilience to extreme conditions, were initially reported to possess an even higher level of HGT than bdelloid rotifers, with one study claiming ~17.5% of genes in Hypsibius exemplaris were foreign-derived.39 This seemed to support the hypothesis linking extremotolerance and DNA break-induced HGT. However, subsequent independent genome sequencing and re-analyses of the same and related tardigrade species (Ramazzottius varieornatus) by different research groups found dramatically lower levels of HGT (estimated upper bound ~2.3%), concluding that the vast majority of the initially reported foreign genes were artifacts resulting from bacterial and other microbial contamination in the DNA samples.50 This case serves as a critical cautionary tale about the challenges of HGT detection, particularly the pervasive issue of contamination, especially when studying small organisms that consume microbes.18 While extensive HGT linked to desiccation is now largely refuted in tardigrades, a small number of genuine HGT events likely still exist.50
Arthropod Adaptations via HGT: HGT has played a significant role in the adaptation of various arthropod lineages (insects, mites) to specific ecological niches, especially herbivory.18 Key examples include:
Plant Cell Wall Degradation: Acquisition of genes encoding enzymes like cellulases, xylanases, polygalacturonases, and pectin methylesterases from bacterial and fungal donors has enabled diverse beetle groups (e.g., longhorns, weevils, leaf beetles), stick insects, and plant bugs to efficiently digest plant structural polysaccharides like cellulose, xylan, and pectin.21 For instance, the coffee berry borer acquired a bacterial mannanase to digest coffee bean storage carbohydrates 51, and leaf beetles (Plagiodera versicolora) acquired bacterial cellulases enabling them to specialize on mature, high-cellulose leaves.79
Detoxification: Arthropods feeding on chemically defended plants have acquired detoxification genes. Spider mites, Lepidoptera, and psyllids obtained bacterial cysteine synthase (CAS) genes to neutralize cyanide.51 Spider mites also acquired a plant cyanase gene and a fungal dioxygenase gene for further detoxification.51 A landmark example is the transfer of a plant phenolic glucoside malonyltransferase gene (BtPMaT1) to the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, allowing it to detoxify a major class of plant defense compounds and significantly broaden its host plant range.21
Nutrient Acquisition/Metabolism: Genes for digesting plant sugars (β-fructofuranosidases) have been transferred from bacteria to Lepidoptera, beetles, flies, and mites.51 Genes potentially involved in manipulating plant metabolism (chorismate mutase) were transferred to Hemiptera.51 These transfers demonstrate how HGT can provide arthropods with key enzymatic tools to overcome plant defenses and utilize plant biomass, driving their ecological success and diversification as herbivores.51
Wolbachia Endosymbiont Transfers: The intracellular bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia is widespread among arthropods and frequently engages in HGT with its hosts.19 Large fragments, sometimes encompassing nearly the entire bacterial genome, have been found integrated into the nuclear genomes of diverse insects, including the bean beetle (Callosobruchus chinensis), fruit flies (Drosophila ananassae), mosquitoes, and parasitoid wasps (Nasonia).19 While many of these transferred genes degenerate into pseudogenes over time, some retain transcriptional activity, albeit often at low levels.19 These transfers represent a massive influx of bacterial DNA and potentially contribute raw material for the evolution of novel host functions, such as influencing metabolic pathways in Drosophila.21
Immunity and Metabolism: Beyond herbivory, HGT contributes to other core functions. The transfer of an antibacterial lysozyme gene family has occurred repeatedly across all domains of life, including into animals, likely conferring defensive advantages.28 Genes potentially involved in biomineralization in sponges, the glyoxylate pathway in cnidarians, vitamin B biosynthesis in nematodes, and energetic metabolism or defense in crustaceans have been suggested as HGT candidates from microbial sources.62 In Lepidoptera, a parasitoid killing factor gene acquired from a virus enhances defense against natural enemies.21 The extensive HGT in bdelloid rotifers includes genes involved in diverse metabolic pathways and defense against pathogens.20 These examples highlight HGT's potential to shape fundamental aspects of animal biology.
Other Notable Examples: HGT has been implicated in the transfer of antifreeze proteins between unrelated fish species 19, the acquisition of cellulose biosynthesis capability by tunicates (urochordates) from bacteria 18, and the transfer of genes from wasp bracoviruses into the genomes of their lepidopteran hosts.2
The prevalence of HGT examples linked to diet, parasitism, and symbiosis strongly suggests that these intimate ecological interactions are primary drivers and facilitators of gene transfer in animals. The DNA of consumed organisms, parasites, or symbionts provides a readily available source pool, and the close contact bypasses environmental barriers. Furthermore, the clear adaptive advantages conferred by many successfully transferred genes—enabling exploitation of new food sources, detoxification of defenses, or enhanced survival—indicate that strong natural selection plays a critical role in fixing these initially rare events, leading to significant evolutionary innovations and ecological diversification in recipient lineages.

5. Mechanisms Facilitating Eukaryotic HGT
5.1. Overview
The mechanisms driving HGT in prokaryotes—transformation (uptake of naked DNA), transduction (virus-mediated transfer), and conjugation (direct cell-to-cell transfer via pili)—are relatively well-characterized.2 In eukaryotes, however, the pathways for HGT are more diverse, less understood, and must contend with the additional barriers posed by the nucleus and, in many cases, germline sequestration.2 Often, eukaryotic HGT mechanisms are linked to specific biological interactions or the activity of mobile genetic elements.29

5.2. Proposed Mechanisms
Parasitism and Symbiosis: The intimate and often prolonged physical association between hosts and their parasites or symbionts provides a fertile ground for genetic exchange.4
Vectors and Bridges: Parasites can potentially act as vectors, transferring genetic material between different host species they infect, or facilitating bidirectional exchange between host and parasite.8 For example, parasitic plants form haustoria that physically connect to host vasculature, enabling the transfer not only of nutrients but also potentially mRNA and mitochondrial DNA.2 Arthropod parasites like ticks have been implicated as vectors for TE transfer (e.g., BovB) among their vertebrate hosts.56
Endosymbiont-to-Host Transfer: This is a major route, particularly well-documented for the transfer of genes from the bacterial ancestors of mitochondria and plastids to the eukaryotic nucleus (EGT).12 Similar transfers occur from contemporary endosymbionts like Wolbachia into insect genomes.19 The constant proximity of endosymbiont DNA to the host cellular machinery, especially if the endosymbiont resides near or within germ cells, increases transfer likelihood.19 Some bacteria have evolved specific mechanisms for transfer to eukaryotes; Agrobacterium employs a Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) to inject T-DNA into plant cells, and similar capabilities might exist in other bacteria interacting with eukaryotes.54
Viral Vectors: Viruses are natural agents of gene transfer. By integrating into host genomes or accidentally packaging host DNA during replication, they can mediate HGT between eukaryotic individuals and potentially across species boundaries.2 Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) represent the genomic fossils of past viral HGT events. Viruses have been implicated as vectors for TE transfer between animals 56 and potentially for introner elements (specialized TEs generating introns) in protists like dinoflagellates.98 The transfer of genes from wasp bracoviruses to their lepidopteran hosts is another example.2
Transposable Elements (TEs): The inherent mobility of TEs, encoded by their own transposase or reverse transcriptase enzymes, makes them prime candidates for horizontal transfer (HTT).2 Once transferred to a new genome, they may initially escape host silencing mechanisms and proliferate rapidly.56
Examples: Well-known cases include the P element spreading through Drosophila populations 99, mariner elements crossing animal phyla 99, plant LTR retrotransposons moving between species 2, and BovB LINE elements spreading among mammals and reptiles via tick vectors.56
Starships: A recently characterized superfamily of large DNA transposons found in filamentous fungi represents a breakthrough in understanding eukaryotic HGT mechanisms.63 These elements carry multiple "cargo" genes conferring phenotypes like metal resistance and possess a tyrosine recombinase ("captain") that mediates their mobilization.24 Crucially, experiments have demonstrated that Starships can actively transfer themselves and their cargo horizontally between different fungal species, and even between different genera, under laboratory conditions.63 Comparative genomics suggests such transfers are frequent in nature.63 This provides the first direct evidence of an active, element-encoded mechanism for eukaryote-to-eukaryote HGT.63
Gene Co-mobilization: TEs can sometimes capture and mobilize adjacent host genes during transposition (transduplication), facilitating the HGT of non-TE sequences.83 The transfer of the ToxA virulence gene between three pathogenic fungi infecting wheat appears to have been mediated by a hAT-family DNA transposon, termed ToxhAT, which flanks the gene.80 The discovery of mobile elements like Starships and virus vectors highlights that dedicated biological machinery can evolve to facilitate HGT, suggesting these elements may gain a selective advantage through their ability to spread horizontally, sometimes bringing beneficial cargo genes to new hosts.
Hybridization and Introgression: While sometimes considered distinct from HGT between reproductively isolated species, hybridization followed by backcrossing (introgression) allows substantial gene flow between related eukaryotic species.29 This is particularly common in plants 99 but also occurs in animals, representing a significant form of non-vertical genetic exchange.
Grafting (Plants): The fusion of tissues from different plants, either naturally or artificially, can lead to the exchange of cellular components, including mitochondria, chloroplasts, and even entire nuclei, potentially leading to HGT or the formation of new chimeric organisms.2
Phagocytosis: The engulfment of whole cells or particles by eukaryotic cells, primarily for feeding, inevitably introduces foreign DNA into the predator's cytoplasm.12 If this DNA escapes lysosomal degradation and reaches the nucleus, it could potentially be integrated. This "you are what you eat" hypothesis is considered a plausible general mechanism, especially relevant for phagotrophic protists and potentially contributing to events like the transfer of fungal carotenoid genes to aphids via consumption.6
Direct Uptake (Transformation-like): Eukaryotic cells might be capable of taking up free DNA from the environment, similar to bacterial transformation, although the efficiency and mechanisms are less clear.4 This could be relevant in specific situations, such as during recovery from desiccation where cell membranes might be temporarily permeable, or potentially involving uptake by germ cells under certain conditions.20
Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), Nanotubes, Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), Apoptotic Bodies: These represent pathways for intercellular transfer of macromolecules, including DNA and RNA, within multicellular organisms or potentially between closely interacting organisms.23 EVs (including exosomes) are membrane-bound vesicles released by cells that can carry genetic material to recipient cells.39 Nanotubes can form direct cytoplasmic connections.39 cfDNA released from dying cells, and DNA contained within apoptotic bodies, can potentially be taken up by neighboring cells.39 While primarily studied in the context of physiology and disease (e.g., cancer metastasis, spread of drug resistance), these mechanisms demonstrate pathways for DNA movement between eukaryotic cells that could, under specific circumstances, contribute to HGT across species barriers, particularly in dense microbial communities or host-symbiont interactions.
Given the diversity of eukaryotic life and interactions, it is likely that multiple HGT mechanisms operate, with their relative importance varying significantly depending on the specific organisms and ecological context involved. No single pathway appears sufficient to explain the full range of observed HGT events in eukaryotes.

6. Evolutionary Significance and Adaptive Impact
6.1. HGT as a Source of Eukaryotic Innovation
Horizontal gene transfer provides a potent mechanism for evolutionary innovation in eukaryotes by allowing the rapid acquisition of pre-existing, functional genes or entire pathways from other organisms.5 This process can bypass the typically slower routes of generating novelty through gene duplication, neofunctionalization, or de novo gene evolution from non-coding sequences. By introducing genes that have already been honed by natural selection in a donor lineage, HGT can potentially confer significant adaptive advantages almost instantaneously, expanding the recipient's functional repertoire and increasing the available gene pool beyond its own ancestral lineage.8

6.2. Adaptive Advantages Conferred by HGT
The documented examples of HGT in plants and animals often involve the acquisition of genes that provide clear adaptive benefits, particularly in relation to ecological interactions and environmental challenges:

Novel Metabolic Capabilities: Acquiring genes that enable the utilization of previously inaccessible resources or the synthesis of crucial compounds is a common theme. The ability of aphids to synthesize their own carotenoids, derived from fungal genes, allows them to achieve specific body coloration linked to survival.2 Herbivorous arthropods have repeatedly acquired bacterial and fungal genes encoding Plant Cell Wall Degrading Enzymes (PCWDEs), such as cellulases, xylanases, and pectinases, enabling them to break down tough plant tissues and access nutrients within.21 The coffee berry borer's acquisition of a bacterial mannanase allows it to specialize on coffee beans.51 Transfers of β-fructosidases aid sugar digestion in various insects and mites.51 Other examples include potential metabolic pathway acquisitions in cnidarians and gene transfers facilitating nutrient synthesis in the mealybug symbiosis.39
Enhanced Stress Resistance: HGT can provide genes that enhance tolerance to abiotic stresses. Plants have acquired numerous genes from microbes conferring resistance to heavy metals, salinity, drought, extreme temperatures, and oxidative stress.41 The massive HGT observed in bdelloid rotifers is hypothesized to contribute to their extraordinary resistance to desiccation and radiation, although the precise role of specific transferred genes is still under investigation.20 Fungal Starship transposons carrying metal resistance genes demonstrate a direct link between HGT and stress tolerance.63
Detoxification and Defense: Acquiring genes to neutralize environmental toxins or bolster defenses against enemies is another significant outcome of HGT. Arthropods feeding on toxic plants have gained genes from bacteria, fungi, or even plants themselves to detoxify compounds like cyanides (via CAS or cyanase) or phenolic glucosides (via BtPMaT1).21 The carotenoid-based coloration in aphids affects their interactions with predators and potentially their resistance to insecticides.6 Lepidoptera acquired a viral gene conferring resistance to parasitoids.21 The widespread transfer of antibacterial lysozyme genes across domains likely provides defensive benefits.28 In fungi, the transfer of the ToxA gene between wheat pathogens enhanced their virulence 80, while in bdelloid rotifers, horizontally acquired genes are upregulated during fungal infection.90 The ancient integration of Agrobacterium T-DNA in plants might have initially provided a competitive edge.5
Developmental and Physiological Innovations: While less frequently documented, HGT may occasionally contribute to core physiological or developmental traits. The acquisition of cellulose synthesis genes by tunicates from bacteria is a striking example.18 The transfer of a neochrome gene enabled ferns to adapt to low-light forest environments.2 The long-term evolutionary impact of integrated Agrobacterium genes on plant development remains an area of interest.5
Facilitating Niche Adaptation and Diversification: By providing key innovations, HGT can act as a catalyst for ecological shifts and diversification. The acquisition of genes aiding land adaptation in plants from soil microbes is a prime example.41 The numerous HGT events related to herbivory have undoubtedly facilitated the massive diversification of plant-feeding insects and mites, allowing them to exploit a vast array of plant resources.18 The whitefly's acquisition of BtPMaT1 directly expanded its host range.21 Similarly, HGT in bdelloid rotifers may underpin their ability to thrive in diverse and challenging freshwater environments.20 This pattern strongly suggests that HGT can rapidly equip lineages with the tools needed to invade and adapt to novel ecological niches.
6.3. Selective Pressures on Transferred Genes
For a horizontal transfer to become a stable feature of a eukaryotic genome and contribute to its evolution, the acquired genetic material must successfully navigate several selective hurdles.19

Firstly, the transferred gene must be integrated into the host genome, preferably in a location that allows for proper expression and does not disrupt essential host genes. Secondly, it must acquire the necessary regulatory elements (promoters, terminators, etc.) to be transcribed and translated by the host machinery. Thirdly, and crucially, the gene product must confer some selective advantage to the recipient organism, or at least be neutral, to be maintained and spread within the population.48

Many HGT events likely result in the transfer of non-functional DNA fragments, genes that are incompatible with the host's cellular environment, or genes that offer no benefit.10 Such transfers are expected to be purged from the genome by purifying selection or lost through genetic drift over time. The acquisition of foreign DNA can even impose a fitness cost on the recipient, for example, by increasing genome size and replication time or by interfering with existing genetic networks.10

Therefore, the HGT events that are detected and persist over evolutionary time likely represent only a fraction of the total transfer events that occur. These successful transfers are often those that provide a significant and immediate adaptive advantage, allowing them to overcome the initial barriers and potential fitness costs. This implies that strong positive selection plays a key role in filtering HGT events, preferentially retaining those "jackpot" transfers that offer substantial benefits related to the organism's ecology, such as exploiting a new food source, detoxifying a prevalent toxin, or surviving a specific environmental stress.

Genes that are successfully integrated and maintained often show signs of subsequent adaptation to the host genome. This can include the acquisition of introns (which may enhance expression levels in some eukaryotes, like fungi 25), changes in codon usage patterns to match the host's preferences, and gene duplication followed by functional diversification, as seen with PCWDEs in arthropods 51 and carotenoid genes in aphids.87 Studies in fungi indicate that horizontally acquired genes are often subject to purifying selection once established, suggesting they become integrated into essential cellular functions.25

It is also important to consider selfish genetic elements like TEs, where the transfer primarily benefits the element's own propagation.2 While potentially detrimental or neutral to the host initially, these elements can occasionally be co-opted or "domesticated" by the host genome to perform new functions.2

7. Frequency, Scope, and Detection of Eukaryotic HGT
7.1. Estimated Frequency and Scope
Quantifying the frequency and evolutionary impact of HGT across the vast diversity of eukaryotes remains a significant challenge, and estimates vary considerably depending on the lineages studied and the methodologies employed. It is widely accepted that HGT is substantially less frequent overall in eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes.2 While prokaryotic genomes may have experienced HGT affecting anywhere from a small percentage to the vast majority of their genes 7, estimates for eukaryotes are generally lower, though highly variable.

Early studies, often limited by data availability, suggested very low rates, perhaps affecting less than 1% of genes in some protist groups.17 However, specific lineages have emerged as potential "hotspots" for HGT. Bdelloid rotifers are the most prominent example, with estimates suggesting 8-10% of their expressed genes may be of foreign origin.8 Parasitic plants show high rates of mitochondrial gene transfer.17 Fungi, particularly parasitic species, also appear to engage in HGT more frequently than initially thought, with one study identifying over 20,000 likely prokaryote-derived genes across 829 fungal genomes, representing about 0.21% of the total genes analyzed but originating from thousands of distinct transfer events.25 Phagotrophic protists and arthropod herbivores are other groups where HGT seems relatively common, linked to their feeding strategies.12

Recent large-scale comparative genomic studies, leveraging the increasing number of sequenced eukaryotic genomes, suggest HGT might be more pervasive than previously recognized, even if still less common than in prokaryotes. One study identified between 10 and 243 non-redundant HGT regions per species across 10 representative eukaryotes.41 Another reported 4 to 358 non-redundant HGTs per species in 13 model eukaryotes, finding evidence of HGT in the vast majority (98.7%) of 824 eukaryotic genomes examined.42 These studies suggest that while the number of distinct HGT events might be limited, the transferred regions can sometimes amplify within the host genome, potentially impacting hundreds or thousands of gene copies.41 Conversely, other analyses focusing on phylogenetic congruence across core genes estimate a much lower average genome-wide HGT rate of around 2% across domains.104

This wide range of estimates underscores the difficulty in accurately quantifying HGT in eukaryotes. The true frequency is likely underestimated due to the challenges in detecting ancient or subtle transfer events and the incomplete sampling of eukaryotic diversity. Conversely, methodological artifacts, particularly contamination, can lead to significant overestimation, as highlighted by the tardigrade example.18 Therefore, while HGT demonstrably occurs across the eukaryotic tree of life, its precise frequency and overall contribution relative to vertical inheritance remain active areas of research and debate.

7.2. Methodologies for HGT Detection (Bioinformatics)
Identifying HGT events relies primarily on computational bioinformatics approaches applied to genomic and transcriptomic data. Two main categories of methods are employed: parametric (compositional) and phylogenetic, often used in combination.2

Parametric/Compositional Methods: These methods search for genes or genomic regions exhibiting sequence characteristics that are atypical compared to the background composition of the host genome, inferring that such deviations may indicate a foreign origin.2 Commonly analyzed parameters include GC content, codon usage bias, oligonucleotide frequencies (k-mers), or relative amino acid usage.2 The advantage is that these methods can often be applied to a single genome sequence without requiring extensive comparative data and are computationally less demanding.15 However, they are prone to false positives because atypical composition can arise from various factors unrelated to HGT, such as selection pressures, mutational biases, or even unusual gene length.15 They are also ineffective at detecting transfers between organisms with similar compositional biases or identifying ancient transfers where the acquired gene has ameliorated to match the host's composition over time.2 Due to these limitations, compositional methods are often used as an initial screening step to identify candidate HGT regions for further investigation.15 Tools implementing these approaches include Alien Hunter and IslandViewer 55, and specific pipelines like preHGT 72 or ShadowCaster 36 utilize variations of these methods.
Phylogenetic Methods: These methods are generally considered more robust for inferring evolutionary history, including HGT.15 They work by reconstructing the evolutionary tree for a specific gene of interest and comparing its topology (branching pattern) to the established or expected phylogeny of the species involved.2 A statistically significant incongruence—where the gene tree places the recipient species unexpectedly close to a distant donor lineage, contradicting the species tree—is taken as strong evidence for HGT.15 While powerful, phylogenetic methods are computationally intensive and face challenges, including the need for accurate ortholog identification, reliable species tree references, sensitivity to errors in sequence alignment and phylogenetic model choice, and difficulty resolving ancient events or transfers between closely related species where phylogenetic signal may be weak or conflicting.15 Tools like HGTphyloDetect 30 and MetaCHIP 66 automate parts of this process.
Similarity-Based ("Best Match") Methods: These approaches involve searching sequence databases (e.g., using BLAST) with a query gene and examining the taxonomic origin of the top hits.11 If the best match comes from a phylogenetically distant organism rather than a close relative, HGT is suspected. Indices like the Alien Index or HGT index quantify this discrepancy.18 While simple and widely used, often within larger pipelines like HGTector 30, these methods are highly susceptible to errors caused by incomplete taxon sampling, differential gene loss, and biases in database composition.15
Other Approaches: Analysis of gene synteny (conservation of gene order) around a putative HGT can provide supporting evidence by revealing breakpoint patterns consistent with insertion, helping to distinguish true HGT from contamination or paralogy.47 Newer methods leverage next-generation sequencing (NGS) data directly, using read mapping information (split reads, discordant pairs, coverage depth) to identify HGT integration sites with high resolution, potentially capturing recent or ongoing events.67
Given the limitations of each individual method, a robust HGT detection strategy typically involves a "total evidence" approach, combining results from multiple independent methods (e.g., using compositional analysis for initial screening, followed by rigorous phylogenetic validation and checks for synteny) to build a stronger case for HGT.15

7.3. Challenges and Pitfalls in Detection
Accurately identifying HGT events in eukaryotic genomes is fraught with challenges and potential pitfalls that can lead to both false positives (incorrectly inferring HGT) and false negatives (missing true HGT events).

Contamination: As dramatically illustrated by the tardigrade case, contamination of sequencing samples with DNA from other organisms (bacteria, fungi, prey items, lab contaminants) is a major confounding factor.18 If contaminant sequences are mistakenly incorporated into the genome assembly of the target eukaryote, they will appear as strong HGT candidates using standard detection methods. This is particularly problematic for studies involving small organisms, environmental sequencing (metagenomics), or organisms with intimate microbial associations (e.g., hosts with microbiomes, phagotrophs).33 Rigorous quality control, assembly validation, checking for eukaryotic features like introns in putative bacterial transfers 57, and synteny analysis are crucial to mitigate this issue.47
Gene Loss and Differential Loss (Hidden Paralogy): The evolutionary history of gene loss can mimic HGT signals.18 If an ancestral gene duplicates, and different descendant lineages subsequently lose different copies (paralogs), the remaining genes may show a phylogenetic relationship incongruent with the species tree. This "hidden paralogy" can be mistaken for HGT if not carefully assessed through comprehensive phylogenetic analysis with dense taxon sampling to uncover the duplication event.18
Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS): During periods of rapid speciation, ancestral genetic polymorphisms may sort randomly into descendant lineages, leading to situations where a gene tree topology differs from the species tree purely by chance.47 This incongruence can resemble HGT, especially when analyzing relationships between closely related species. Statistical methods examining the expected patterns of incongruence under ILS models can help differentiate it from HGT in some cases.47
Endosymbiotic Gene Transfer (EGT): Eukaryotic nuclear genomes contain numerous genes transferred from their mitochondrial and plastid endosymbionts.12 These EGT events represent a form of intracellular HGT but need to be distinguished from HGT originating from external donors. Phylogenetic analysis can typically identify the characteristic α-proteobacterial or cyanobacterial ancestry of these genes.45
Analytical Artifacts in Phylogenetics: Errors in the process of phylogenetic reconstruction itself can generate spurious incongruence mistaken for HGT.47 These include errors in multiple sequence alignment, the use of inappropriate models of sequence evolution, failure to account for variation in evolutionary rates across sites (rate heterogeneity) or across lineages over time (heterotachy), and systematic biases like long-branch attraction.61
Database Bias and Limited Sampling: The accuracy of similarity searches and phylogenetic analyses heavily depends on the completeness and taxonomic breadth of sequence databases.18 If the true donor lineage or closely related eukaryotic sequences are absent or underrepresented in the database, a gene might artifactually appear most similar to a distant taxon, leading to a false HGT inference.18 Increasing the representation of eukaryotic diversity in databases is critical for improving HGT detection accuracy.34
Difficulty Detecting Ancient or Recent/Close Transfers: Very ancient HGT events are challenging to detect because the transferred gene sequence may have diverged significantly and acquired compositional characteristics similar to the host genome, erasing the phylogenetic and compositional signals of its foreign origin.2 Conversely, very recent transfers or transfers between closely related species may exhibit insufficient sequence divergence to be confidently distinguished from vertical inheritance using phylogenetic methods.32
Addressing these challenges requires careful experimental design, rigorous bioinformatic filtering, the use of multiple complementary detection methods, thorough phylogenetic analysis with appropriate models and dense taxon sampling, and critical evaluation of alternative explanations for observed genomic patterns. No single method is infallible, and a convergence of evidence is needed for high confidence in HGT identification.

8. Synthesis and Future Directions
8.1. HGT's Role in Eukaryotic vs. Microbial Evolution
The evolutionary roles of Horizontal Gene Transfer differ substantially between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In Bacteria and Archaea, HGT is a fundamental and pervasive process, acting as a primary engine for adaptation and diversification.2 It facilitates the rapid spread of traits like antibiotic resistance and novel metabolic pathways, contributes significantly to the concept of a fluid pan-genome within microbial communities, and generates such extensive phylogenetic incongruence that the traditional "Tree of Life" metaphor is often replaced by a "web" or "network" for prokaryotic evolution.10 The rate of gene gain via HGT often exceeds gene duplication rates in prokaryotes, highlighting its role as the principal route for acquiring evolutionary innovations.26

In eukaryotes, particularly plants and animals, HGT occurs but is generally considered less frequent and less pervasive than in microbes.2 While it can be a significant source of novel genes and adaptive traits, enabling adaptation to specific niches or challenges (e.g., herbivory, parasitism, stress tolerance), it does not appear to fundamentally overwhelm the signal of vertical inheritance for the majority of the genome in most eukaryotic lineages.10 Eukaryotic evolution seems primarily driven by vertical descent with modification (mutation, recombination, gene duplication), with HGT acting as an important, but more episodic, contributor of innovation. The "Tree of Life" concept, while needing to incorporate reticulations to account for HGT and hybridization, remains a more applicable framework for eukaryotes than for prokaryotes.47

8.2. Current Understanding and Remaining Questions
Current research establishes that HGT is not merely an anomaly but a recurring theme in the evolution of plants and animals. Diverse mechanisms, often linked to ecological interactions like parasitism, symbiosis, and predation, or mediated by mobile genetic elements like viruses and transposons, facilitate these transfers despite significant biological barriers. Functionally, acquired genes have demonstrably provided key adaptations, enabling recipients to exploit new resources, resist stresses, and neutralize defenses. However, the frequency of HGT varies dramatically across eukaryotic lineages, with certain groups like bdelloid rotifers, parasitic plants, and some fungi appearing as potential hotspots. Detection methodologies are sophisticated but face persistent challenges, particularly in distinguishing true HGT from artifacts like contamination and other evolutionary processes like gene loss or ILS.

Despite progress, many fundamental questions remain:

What is the true frequency and quantitative impact of HGT across the full breadth of eukaryotic diversity?
What are the relative contributions and efficiencies of the various proposed transfer mechanisms (e.g., viruses vs. TEs vs. direct contact) in different lineages and environments?
How often are transferred genes successfully integrated and expressed compared to being lost or silenced? What factors determine successful integration and functionalization?
Are certain eukaryotic genomes or lineages inherently more susceptible to HGT than others, and why?
What is the full extent of HGT's contribution to major eukaryotic evolutionary innovations and adaptive radiations?
How does HGT interact with other evolutionary forces, such as gene duplication, polyploidy, and vertical mutation, in shaping eukaryotic genomes?
8.3. Impact on Phylogeny ("Web vs. Tree")
HGT complicates phylogenetic reconstruction in eukaryotes by introducing conflicting signals into genomic datasets.2 A gene acquired horizontally will have an evolutionary history incongruent with the vertically inherited genes of its host, potentially leading to incorrect inferences of species relationships if not identified and properly handled. However, the impact appears less pervasive than in prokaryotes, where HGT can obscure deep phylogenetic relationships.10 In eukaryotes, while HGT adds 'web-like' reticulations to the evolutionary tree, a core signal of vertical descent generally remains discernible for most genes.10 Paradoxically, once identified, HGT events themselves can sometimes serve as valuable phylogenetic markers, providing evidence for relationships or relative timing of divergence events between otherwise distantly related groups.33 Accurately reconstructing eukaryotic phylogeny in the genomic era requires methods that can explicitly model or account for the confounding effects of HGT alongside other sources of incongruence like ILS.

8.4. Ongoing Research and Future Directions
The study of HGT in eukaryotes is a dynamic and rapidly advancing field, fueled by technological and analytical progress. Future research will likely focus on several key areas:

Expanding Genomic Resources: Continued sequencing of diverse eukaryotic genomes, particularly from undersampled branches of the tree of life (including various protist groups, invertebrates, and non-model plants and fungi), is essential to gain a more complete picture of HGT's scope and distribution.8
Improving Detection Methods: Developing more accurate, sensitive, and computationally efficient bioinformatics tools is crucial.2 This includes refining methods to distinguish HGT from confounding factors like contamination, gene loss, and ILS, mitigating database biases, and potentially leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches.23
Elucidating Mechanisms: Experimental studies are needed to directly investigate the mechanisms of transfer. The recent work demonstrating Starship-mediated HGT in fungi provides a powerful model system.63 Further research into the roles of viruses, parasites, EVs, and other potential vectors is warranted.
Functional Validation: Moving beyond computational prediction to experimentally verify the function and adaptive significance of putative horizontally transferred genes is critical for understanding their biological impact.19
Ecological Context: Investigating HGT within specific ecological frameworks, such as host-parasite co-evolution, symbioses, or adaptation to extreme environments, will provide deeper insights into the drivers and consequences of gene transfer.8
Host-HGT Interactions: Understanding how host genomes respond to and potentially defend against HGT (e.g., via RNA interference, DNA methylation, or CRISPR-like systems if present) is an emerging area.
This ongoing research, integrating genomics, bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, and experimental approaches, promises to further illuminate the complex role of horizontal gene transfer in shaping the evolution and diversity of eukaryotic life. The field is clearly moving beyond simply documenting HGT occurrences towards a more mechanistic and quantitative understanding of its processes and broader evolutionary consequences.

9. Conclusions
Horizontal Gene Transfer, long recognized as a cornerstone of prokaryotic evolution, is now demonstrably a significant, albeit less frequent, evolutionary force in eukaryotes, including complex multicellular plants and animals. Despite substantial biological barriers such as germline sequestration, nuclear compartmentalization, and divergent gene expression systems, HGT occurs across diverse eukaryotic lineages.

The mechanisms facilitating these transfers are varied and often linked to specific ecological interactions or mobile genetic elements. Intimate associations like parasitism and symbiosis, vectors such as viruses and transposable elements (including specialized cargo-carrying elements like Starships), and potentially processes like phagocytosis or direct DNA uptake in specific contexts, provide pathways for genetic material to cross species boundaries.

While many HGT events may be transient or non-functional, those that persist often confer significant adaptive advantages. Documented examples in plants and animals reveal the acquisition of novel metabolic capabilities (e.g., carotenoid synthesis in aphids, plant cell wall digestion in arthropods), enhanced resistance to abiotic stresses (e.g., desiccation, toxins, temperature extremes), improved defenses against pathogens or predators, and adaptations facilitating the colonization of new ecological niches (e.g., herbivory, land adaptation). This highlights HGT as a potent source of rapid evolutionary innovation in eukaryotes.

However, accurately detecting HGT events and quantifying their frequency remains challenging. Methodological pitfalls, particularly contamination artifacts and distinguishing HGT from processes like gene loss and incomplete lineage sorting, require rigorous analytical approaches and careful interpretation. Current estimates of HGT frequency vary widely, suggesting our understanding of its true scope across the eukaryotic tree of life is still incomplete.

In synthesis, HGT in eukaryotes represents a fascinating counterpoint to the dominant mode of vertical inheritance. While not reshaping eukaryotic genomes to the extent seen in prokaryotes, it acts as an important supplemental source of genetic novelty, introducing impactful functional capabilities that have significantly influenced the adaptation and diversification of specific lineages. Future research combining expanded genomic sampling, refined bioinformatics methods, and experimental validation will continue to unravel the intricate mechanisms, frequency, and full evolutionary significance of horizontal gene flow in the eukaryotic domain.
