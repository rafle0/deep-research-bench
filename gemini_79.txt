Navigating the Frame: Transgender Representation in Middle Eastern and North African Cinema
I. Introduction: Transgender Representation in MENA Cinema
A. Situating the Study: Importance and Complexity
The study of transgender representation within the cinemas of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is a nascent yet crucial field of inquiry. Analyzing cultural productions from this diverse region offers vital perspectives that challenge pervasive stereotypes and simplistic understandings often prevalent in Western discourse, particularly concerning gender and sexuality. Films provide a unique lens through which to examine how identities are constructed, negotiated, and represented within specific cultural and political milieus. However, embarking on such a study necessitates acknowledging the profound complexities involved. The MENA region encompasses a vast array of cultural, linguistic, and political contexts, resisting easy generalization. The social, legal, and political realities for transgender individuals vary significantly from one country to another, shaped by distinct historical trajectories, legal systems often influenced by colonial legacies and Islamic jurisprudence, and the impact of globalized queer discourses and activism.1 Therefore, a nuanced analytical approach is essential, one that respects the specificity of individual national cinemas and socio-political environments while tracing broader regional currents.

B. Overview of MENA Contexts and Cinematic Landscape
The backdrop against which MENA films featuring transgender themes are produced and received is marked by significant legal precarity and social hostility for many LGBTQ+ individuals, including transgender people.2 Legal frameworks range from outright criminalization of same-sex intimacy (often used against trans individuals) and gender non-conformity under vague 'morality' laws, as seen in countries like Morocco and Tunisia 4, to systems of conditional tolerance based on medicalized understandings of trans identity, notably in Iran.8 Even where explicit criminalization is absent, legal ambiguity and discriminatory enforcement create environments of fear and vulnerability.1 Consequently, overt transgender representation in MENA cinema remains relatively scarce compared to Western film landscapes. This scarcity imbues the existing examples with particular significance, demanding close analysis. Themes related to transgender identity may sometimes be explored elliptically, through coded narratives, or within the broader context of queer experiences, reflecting the constraints and risks faced by filmmakers and subjects alike.10

C. Theoretical Frameworks: Intersecting Trans and Film Theories
To adequately analyze these cinematic representations, this paper employs a dual theoretical lens, integrating key concepts from Transgender Studies and Film Studies. Trans Studies offers frameworks for understanding identity formation, the complexities of embodiment, the politics of visibility, the social construction of gender through performativity, and the importance of intersectionality in shaping lived experiences.12 Foundational thinkers like Judith Butler, Jack Halberstam, and Susan Stryker provide critical tools for deconstructing gender norms and analyzing trans subjectivities.12 Complementing this, Film Studies provides methodologies for analyzing representation as a process of constructing meaning, rather than simple reflection.14 Concepts such as narrative analysis, the function of the cinematic gaze (building on Laura Mulvey's work), genre conventions, and the specific language of cinema (mise-en-scène, cinematography, editing, sound) are crucial for understanding how films create meaning about transgender lives.14 Theorists like Stuart Hall and Richard Dyer inform the critique of how media representations relate to ideology and power.14 This paper argues that intersecting these theoretical fields is essential. Only by considering how cinematic techniques and narrative structures interact with specific socio-legal contexts and theoretical understandings of gender identity can we fully grasp how MENA films represent, and sometimes contest, dominant norms surrounding transgender existence.

D. Thesis Statement and Paper Structure
This paper argues that while MENA cinema addressing transgender themes remains limited, the existing films offer complex, often contradictory, representations that navigate restrictive socio-legal environments and engage critically with both local norms and global discourses of gender identity. These films frequently foreground the tension between state-sanctioned pathways (where they exist) and pervasive social stigma, highlighting the resilience and agency of transgender individuals alongside the profound challenges they face. Through detailed analysis of key films such as the Iranian narrative Facing Mirrors (2011), the Iranian documentary Be Like Others (2008), and the Afghan/Swedish short documentary Leila (2023), informed by the intersecting frameworks of trans and film theory, this study reveals the specific strategies employed by filmmakers to represent trans experiences within diverse and often hostile contexts. The paper proceeds by first outlining the varied socio-legal terrain for transgender people across the MENA region (Section II), then detailing the relevant theoretical concepts (Section III), followed by in-depth analyses of the selected case studies (Section IV), a synthesis of findings identifying patterns and divergences (Section V), and concluding reflections (Section VI).

II. Navigating Identities: The Socio-Legal Terrain for Transgender People in MENA
A. Diverse Legal Frameworks: Criminalization, Pathologization, and Conditional Recognition
The legal landscape for transgender individuals across the Middle East and North Africa is characterized by a lack of consistent protection and recognition, marked by significant variation between countries.1 In many nations, there are no explicit laws safeguarding the rights of transgender people based on their gender identity, leaving them highly vulnerable to discrimination and abuse.2 Instead of protective legislation, authorities often utilize vaguely worded laws related to 'public morality,' 'indecency,' or 'debauchery' to target LGBTQ+ individuals. Security forces frequently conflate gender identity with sexual orientation, prosecuting transgender women as gay men and transgender men as lesbian women under these statutes.3

This is evident in Egypt, where despite historical periods of relative tolerance regarding same-sex relations 16, contemporary law uses provisions against "debauchery" (Fujur) and "scandalous acts" to arbitrarily arrest and prosecute LGBTQ+ people, including transgender individuals.3 Similarly, Morocco's Penal Code (Article 489) criminalizes "lewd or unnatural acts with an individual of the same sex," carrying prison sentences and fines, and this law is actively enforced against LGBTQ+ individuals.4 Article 483, criminalizing acts against public decency, has also been used.18 Tunisia employs Article 230 of its Penal Code, a remnant of the French colonial era (though ironically absent from the French code itself), to punish same-sex relations with imprisonment, alongside Articles 226 and 226 bis targeting 'indecency' and acts against 'public morals'.6 Recent crackdowns have seen arrests based merely on appearance or gender expression.7

In stark contrast, Iran presents a unique and complex situation stemming from Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa in the 1980s.8 This religious edict permits sex reassignment surgery (SRS) for individuals "diagnosed" as transsexuals, explicitly distinguishing this from homosexuality, which remains punishable by death.9 This has led to a state-sanctioned, albeit highly medicalized and controlled, pathway for gender transition.9 The process is arduous, requiring individuals over 18 to obtain parental approval, undergo extensive psychiatric evaluation (often reinforcing shame), hormone tests, chromosomal tests, and approval from the Family Court via the Legal Medicine Organization, which aims to "filter" transsexuals (deemed "curable") from homosexuals (deemed "deviant").9 Legal gender recognition on official documents is possible only after surgery and sterilization.9 While the government may offer some financial assistance, it often falls short, and the underlying framework pathologizes trans identity as a "mental disorder" requiring medical intervention, rather than affirming self-identified gender.9 Recent proposals in Turkey suggest a potential move towards a more restrictive model, seeking to raise the age for transition, require proof of permanent infertility (a previously struck-down requirement), and mandate lengthy state assessments, while also criminalizing LGBTQ+ expression.24

Egypt's approach also reveals layers of complexity. While SRS is theoretically possible, access is mediated by a restrictive review committee within the Medical Syndicate, established in 2003, which includes religious representation from Dar Al Ifta and Al-Azhar.3 This committee reportedly met irregularly and, between 2014-2017, approved cases for "physical" (intersex) reasons but none based on "gender identity disorder," reflecting a religious interpretation that distinguishes between permissible "sex correction" for intersex individuals and impermissible "sex change" for transgender individuals, who are deemed better treated psychiatrically.3 Egyptian courts have echoed this stance, rejecting legal gender recognition requests from transgender individuals based on principles of Islamic Shari'a that pathologize Gender Identity Disorder (GID).3

Lebanon occupies another distinct space. While Article 534 of the Penal Code, prohibiting "sexual intercourse contrary to nature," has been used to target LGBTQ+ individuals, including transgender people, several lower court rulings since 2009, culminating in a 2018 Court of Appeals decision, have argued that consensual same-sex conduct does not constitute an "unnatural offense".25 However, these rulings lack binding precedent under Lebanon's civil law system, meaning Article 534 can still be applied, and other laws concerning "public decency" remain tools for harassment.25 Furthermore, there is no clear pathway for legal gender recognition 3, and activists face significant obstacles to freedom of association.25 Turkey, despite decriminalizing same-sex acts in 1858 and allowing legal gender change since 1988 (albeit with requirements like surgery and sterilization), has seen a deterioration in the climate for LGBTQ+ rights, with failed attempts at constitutional protections, increasing state hostility, bans on Pride events since 2015, and the aforementioned proposed legislative rollbacks.24

This overview reveals a critical dynamic: the conditional space afforded to transgender individuals in countries like Iran, and to some extent Egypt, is predicated on the very pathologization of their identity. The legal and medical systems permit transition only when framed as a medical necessity or a "cure," distinct from the criminalized category of homosexuality.3 This contrasts sharply with international human rights standards advocating for depathologization and legal gender recognition based on self-determination.2 This medical gatekeeping, requiring psychiatric validation and often invasive procedures, creates a constrained form of existence and visibility, fundamentally different from contexts where self-identification is the basis for rights, or where identity is simply criminalized outright.

Furthermore, in nations like Egypt, Lebanon, and Tunisia, the absence of clear, protective legislation for transgender individuals, coupled with the existence of broad, ambiguous 'morality' laws, functions as a potent mechanism of state control.3 This legal gray area allows for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by authorities. Police can target individuals based on appearance, perceived identity, or association, fostering a climate of pervasive fear and uncertainty.3 While courts might occasionally issue progressive interpretations, as seen in Lebanon 25, the lack of binding precedent or legislative reform means that vulnerability persists. This calculated ambiguity is not a legislative oversight but an effective tool for maintaining social order according to dominant norms, profoundly impacting daily life, access to essential services, and potentially chilling artistic expression and activism.

The following table provides a comparative summary of the legal status for transgender individuals in selected MENA countries:

Country	Criminalization of Same-Sex Acts (Often Conflated)	Explicit Transgender Criminalization?	Legal Gender Recognition Pathway	Key Legal Articles/Fatwas/Rulings Cited	Notes

B. Social Realities: Stigma, Discrimination, Violence, and Mental Health
Beyond the legal frameworks, transgender individuals in the MENA region face pervasive social stigma and discrimination that permeate all aspects of life.1 This manifests in significant barriers to accessing employment, housing, healthcare, and education.2 The lack of legal gender recognition on official documents exacerbates these challenges, creating difficulties in everyday life and travel.2 Transgender people report high rates of harassment and violence, not only from society at large but also frequently at the hands of state authorities, particularly the police.1 Arbitrary arrests are common, and detention conditions can be abusive, with individuals often placed in facilities that do not align with their gender identity or subjected to solitary confinement.3 Ill-treatment, including sexual violence and forced anal examinations (considered torture by Amnesty International), has been documented in countries like Egypt and Tunisia.3

This environment of constant discrimination, threat, and violence takes a severe toll on mental health. Research, particularly among MENA LGBTQ+ youth (a category often inclusive of trans youth in studies), indicates significantly higher rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide attempts compared to non-LGBTQ+ peers.29 School environments are often hostile, with high rates of feeling unsafe, hearing biased remarks (homophobic, transphobic, racist, and anti-religious), and experiencing harassment or assault based on sexual orientation, gender expression, race/ethnicity, or perceived religion.30 Despite these acute mental health needs, access to care is often limited. Many young people fear seeking parental permission, worry they won't be taken seriously, or fear that therapists will not understand their specific cultural or racial/ethnic background, hindering effective treatment.29

The vulnerability experienced by transgender individuals is not uniform; it is often compounded by intersecting factors. Socio-economic status plays a critical role, affecting one's ability to afford gender-affirming healthcare (even where partially subsidized, like in Iran 9), secure safe housing, or access legal aid. Geographic location also matters, with experiences potentially differing significantly between metropolitan centers and more conservative rural areas.25 Furthermore, the status of being a refugee or migrant adds another layer of precarity. Transgender refugees, such as Syrians in Lebanon or Turkey, face compounded discrimination based on both their gender identity and their nationality or refugee status, navigating hostile social environments alongside complex and often unsympathetic asylum systems.25 Lebanon's multiple crises (economic collapse, political instability, post-explosion recovery) have been shown to exacerbate discrimination against marginalized groups, including LGBTQI+ individuals and refugees, pushing them further into economic hardship and increasing social antagonism.26 Understanding these intersections is crucial, as they reveal that the "transgender experience" in the MENA region is multifaceted and deeply shaped by factors beyond gender identity alone.

C. Influencing Factors: Religion, Colonial Legacies, and Patriarchy
The challenging socio-legal environment for transgender people in the MENA region is shaped by a confluence of factors. Conservative interpretations of Islamic texts play a significant role in shaping public attitudes and, in some cases, state policy. Debates around whether gender transition constitutes "changing God's creation" (haram) influence legal and medical bodies, as seen in the resistance to non-intersex SRS by figures associated with Egypt's Al-Azhar.3 Conversely, specific interpretations, like Khomeini's fatwa, have created unique, albeit restrictive, legal avenues in Iran by differentiating transsexuality (seen as a medical condition) from homosexuality.8

The legacy of Western colonialism also casts a long shadow. Some scholars argue that certain laws currently used to police gender and sexuality, such as those criminalizing "debauchery" or "unnatural acts," were introduced during colonial periods, often modeled on European legal codes like the Napoleonic Code or British regulations, and were sometimes layered onto or reacted against existing social norms.1 These colonial-era laws have persisted and been adapted in the post-colonial era to control populations and enforce specific moral codes.

Underpinning both religious conservatism and legal frameworks are deeply entrenched patriarchal structures.1 These structures enforce rigid gender binaries, control female sexuality, and uphold male dominance. Resistance to gender non-conformity and diverse sexualities is often rooted in the perceived threat these pose to traditional family structures and patriarchal authority.28 The combination of conservative religious interpretations, colonial legal remnants, and pervasive patriarchy creates a complex web of constraints that significantly impacts the lives and rights of transgender individuals across the region.

III. Analytical Toolkit: Applying Trans and Film Theory
Analyzing cinematic representations of transgender lives in the MENA region requires a robust theoretical toolkit that draws from both Transgender Studies and Film Studies. These intersecting fields provide the concepts necessary to unpack the complex ways films construct meaning about gender identity, embodiment, and social experience within specific cultural and political contexts.

A. Key Concepts from Trans Studies
Central to this analysis is a clear understanding of core terminology. Gender identity refers to an individual's internal sense of being male, female, both, neither, or somewhere else along the gender spectrum, which may or may not correspond to the sex assigned at birth. This is distinct from gender expression (how one outwardly presents gender) and sexual orientation (who one is attracted to).2 Gender affirmation encompasses the various steps an individual may take to live according to their gender identity, which can include social changes (name, pronouns), legal changes (gender markers on documents), and medical interventions (hormone therapy, surgeries), though not all trans people pursue all or any of these steps.2 International human rights frameworks emphasize the importance of legal gender recognition based on self-determination, contrasting with systems requiring medical proof or invasive procedures.2

Judith Butler's concept of gender performativity is highly influential. Butler argues that gender is not an internal essence but is constituted through the stylized repetition of acts, gestures, and enactments over time – essentially, gender is something one does, rather than something one is.13 This theory suggests that gender norms are socially constructed and maintained through performance, and potentially subverted through non-normative performances. While powerful for deconstructing gender binaries, some trans theorists like Julia Serano have expressed concern that performativity might be misinterpreted to imply that trans identities are not real or authentic, setting up tensions between queer theory and some strands of trans activism.12 Nonetheless, performativity offers a valuable lens for analyzing how characters in films perform or resist gender norms.

The concept of visibility politics addresses the double-edged nature of representation. Increased visibility can foster understanding, build community, and advance rights, but it can also lead to backlash, increased surveillance, tokenism, and violence, particularly for already marginalized groups.17 Analyzing MENA trans cinema involves considering how films contribute to visibility and weighing the potential positive and negative consequences within specific contexts.34

Discussions of embodiment are also crucial. Trans experiences often involve complex relationships with the body, sometimes described through the historically significant, though potentially problematic, phrase "trapped in the wrong body".12 Analyzing how films depict trans bodies – experiences of dysphoria, euphoria, transition, or simply existing – is key to understanding their representational politics.

Finally, intersectionality, the concept highlighting how different axes of identity (race, class, religion, nationality, sexuality, gender identity, ability, etc.) intersect to shape unique experiences of oppression and privilege, is indispensable.13 As established in the previous section, the experiences of transgender individuals in MENA are deeply affected by factors beyond gender identity alone, and films must be analyzed for how they address (or ignore) these intersections.26 The term trans*, sometimes used with an asterisk, emerged as an attempt to create an inclusive umbrella term that acknowledges the diversity of gender variance beyond binary categories and resists definitive categorization, though its usage continues to evolve.12

B. Key Concepts from Film Studies
Film theory provides the tools to analyze how these themes and identities are represented cinematically. Representation, as theorized by Stuart Hall and Richard Dyer, is understood not as a mirror reflecting reality, but as a process of constructing meaning through signifying practices.14 Films use codes, conventions, and stereotypes to make sense of the world, often reinforcing dominant ideologies but also potentially offering counter-narratives. Analyzing representation involves asking how trans identities are constructed, what meanings are encoded, and how these relate to power structures within MENA societies.14

Narrative analysis examines the structure of the story, character development, plot progression, and the use of narrative conventions (e.g., conflict, resolution, character arcs).14 How are the life stories of transgender characters framed? Do narratives follow familiar patterns (e.g., tragedy, overcoming adversity, transition journey), and what are the implications of these choices?

Laura Mulvey's concept of the "male gaze" in classical Hollywood cinema described how camera work, editing, and narrative often position the spectator to view female characters as objects of male desire.14 This concept can be adapted to analyze the gaze in MENA trans cinema. Is there a dominant cisgender gaze that frames trans bodies as spectacle, curiosity, or threat? Does a medical gaze operate in documentaries focusing on transition, potentially objectifying subjects through a clinical lens (as might be considered in Be Like Others)? How does the film position the spectator in relation to the transgender subject?

Genre plays a significant role in shaping expectations and interpretations. Whether a film is a drama, documentary, melodrama, or incorporates elements of other genres influences how transgender themes are presented and received.10 Documentary, for instance, carries claims to authenticity and truth-telling, raising specific ethical considerations regarding representation.22

Finally, cinematic language – encompassing mise-en-scène (setting, props, costume, performance), cinematography (camera angles, movement, lighting), editing (pacing, juxtaposition), and sound design (music, dialogue, ambient sound) – provides the specific formal elements through which meaning is conveyed. Analyzing these technical choices reveals how filmmakers shape the audience's perception and understanding of transgender experiences and the surrounding social world.

C. Synthesizing Theories for Analyzing Trans Cinema in MENA
Integrating these theoretical frameworks allows for a multi-layered analysis. For example, one can analyze how a character's performance of gender (Butler) unfolds within the film's narrative structure, while simultaneously using representation theory (Hall) to critique the ideological implications of that portrayal within the specific socio-legal context depicted. Film techniques, such as the gaze or editing choices, can be examined for how they reinforce or challenge dominant ways of seeing and understanding trans bodies, linking formal cinematic elements directly to the politics of trans identity.

This integrated approach also helps identify potentially problematic representational strategies. For instance, some documentaries about marginalized groups, particularly those produced for international audiences or within humanitarian frameworks, may adopt what can be termed a "humanitarian gaze." This mode of representation often centers narratives of suffering, victimhood, and precarity, aiming to elicit sympathy, authenticate the subject's need for intervention (like asylum), or highlight individual resilience against overwhelming odds.32 While potentially raising awareness, this focus can inadvertently reinforce stereotypes of passive victimhood, flatten complex experiences, and align with a neoliberal emphasis on individual stories over systemic critique.34 This occurs because the narrative structure often prioritizes individual testimonials of trauma and overcoming, which resonate with humanitarian discourses but may obscure broader political struggles or the intersectional nature of oppression.32 Analyzing films through this lens requires questioning how suffering is depicted, for what purpose, and whether the representation ultimately empowers subjects or reduces them to objects of pity or intervention, potentially depoliticizing their struggles in the process. This critical perspective is relevant when examining documentaries like Be Like Others or A Jihad for Love, prompting scrutiny of their narrative choices and intended effects.

IV. Case Studies: In-Depth Film Analyses
Applying the integrated theoretical framework, this section provides in-depth analyses of three distinct films representing transgender themes in MENA cinema: Facing Mirrors (Iran, 2011), Be Like Others (Iran, 2008), and Leila (Afghanistan/Sweden, 2023). Each analysis examines the film's narrative, characterization, cinematic techniques, and engagement with socio-cultural contexts.

A. Analysis 1: Facing Mirrors (Aynehaye Rooberoo, 2011, Iran)
Synopsis & Context: Directed by Negar Azarbayjani, Facing Mirrors is a groundbreaking Iranian narrative feature, the first from the country with a transgender protagonist.37 It tells the story of an unlikely friendship between Rana (Ghazal Shakeri), a devout, working-class wife forced to drive a taxi illegally to support her family while her husband is imprisoned, and Adineh, known as Edi (Shayesteh Irani), a wealthy, pre-operative trans man.37 Edi is fleeing his conservative father who opposes his transition and plans to force him into marriage, while desperately trying to obtain a passport to travel to Germany for gender-affirming surgery.36 The film unfolds against the backdrop of Iran's unique legal situation where SRS is permissible under Khomeini's fatwa, yet social acceptance remains elusive, particularly within families.21
Theoretical Application: This analysis focuses on narrative construction (the "unlikely friendship" trope), character agency and performativity (Edi's negotiation of identity), representation (challenging stereotypes), and intersectionality (class and religious differences).
Detailed Analysis:
Narrative: The film employs the narrative trope of an "unlikely friendship" to bridge the significant social divides between its two protagonists.37 Their initial encounter is fraught with misunderstanding and Rana's panic upon learning Edi is "trans," leading to a car accident.36 However, Edi's subsequent generosity (paying Rana's medical bills) forces them together, allowing empathy to develop gradually.36 The narrative arc follows Rana's journey from fear and judgment, rooted in her traditional beliefs, towards understanding, acceptance, and ultimately, active solidarity in helping Edi escape his oppressive family situation.37 The plot incorporates elements of suspense as Edi attempts to evade his father and secure his passport, but the core remains the development of their relationship.36
Characters: Edi is portrayed with remarkable complexity. Played convincingly by Shayesteh Irani (whose performance was noted for its compelling ambiguity 36), Edi exhibits resilience and defiance against his transphobic father, performing a "tough-guy" masculinity in navigating hostile public spaces, yet also reveals vulnerability, pain, and loneliness, notably in a scene where he cries privately.42 He possesses agency, actively seeking escape and asserting his identity.42 Rana is equally complex; her initial prejudice is contextualized by her traditional background and desperation, but she is not depicted as merely an obstacle. Her transformation is central to the film's humanistic message, showing her capacity for empathy and her own subtle defiance of social norms by working as a taxi driver.37 The film avoids reducing characters to simple victim/oppressor roles, instead exploring their shared experiences of navigating societal constraints.40
Cinematic Techniques: The film uses visual contrasts in mise-en-scène to highlight the different worlds of Rana and Edi. Performance is key, particularly Irani's portrayal of Edi's gender identity. The cinematography often confines the characters within domestic spaces or the taxi, emphasizing their shared predicament and the development of their intimacy. While some critics noted occasional clumsiness in construction (e.g., the staging of the accident 41), the focus remains on the actors' nuanced performances.
Socio-Cultural Engagement: Facing Mirrors directly engages with the contradictions of Iran's stance on transgender identity: the legal possibility of transition (Edi seeks surgery abroad likely due to family opposition and perhaps speed, not fundamental illegality in Iran 36) versus the harsh reality of social and familial rejection.21 It critiques patriarchal control (Edi's father, Rana's husband's imprisonment impacting her) and highlights class differences, while ultimately suggesting solidarity can transcend these divides.37 The film's nuanced portrayal of Iranian life and resistance contrasts sharply with potentially more stereotypical or Orientalist depictions of oppression found in some other internationally focused Iranian films.40 Its success at international LGBTQ+ film festivals and even winning an award at Iran's Fajr Film Festival speaks to its ability to resonate across different contexts.38
Specific Insights: Facing Mirrors utilizes the narrative of a transgender man's struggle for self-determination not just to explore trans issues but also to comment on broader themes of social constraint, female agency (Rana's choices), class disparity, and the potential for human connection and empathy within contemporary Iranian society. By presenting Edi with complexity and agency, the film offers a powerful counter-narrative to simplistic portrayals of victimhood, demonstrating how individuals negotiate identity and resistance within a specific, challenging socio-legal framework.36
B. Analysis 2: Be Like Others (2008, Iran)
Synopsis & Context: Directed by Iranian-American filmmaker Tanaz Eshaghian, Be Like Others is a documentary providing an intimate look into the lives of young Iranian men pursuing gender reassignment surgery at Dr. Bahram Mir-Jalali's clinic in Tehran.22 The film is explicitly framed by Iran's paradoxical legal situation: homosexuality is a capital offense, while SRS is legally sanctioned by Khomeini's fatwa as a "cure" for diagnosed transsexuals.22 The film follows several individuals before and after surgery, exploring their motivations, experiences, and the reactions of their families and society.23
Theoretical Application: This analysis focuses on documentary ethics and representation, the operation of a medical/state gaze, the pressures influencing performativity and identity formation, and the tension between pathologization and self-understanding.
Detailed Analysis:
Narrative/Structure: The documentary structures its narrative around the process of transition, contrasting the experiences of different individuals.22 Key figures include Ali Askar, who transitions to Negar despite familial opposition and faces hardship post-surgery (disownment, depression, sex work), and Anoosh, who transitions to Anahita with his mother's support and initially seems happier, though his relationship with his boyfriend becomes strained.23 This structure highlights the varying outcomes and the critical role of social support.
Representation: The film portrays the subjects with a degree of intimacy, capturing their vulnerability and hopes.43 However, it strongly emphasizes the link between seeking transition and escaping the stigma and danger associated with homosexuality in Iran. Several subjects explicitly state they are not homosexual, viewing it as shameful, and one man is quoted saying, "If I didn't live in Iran, I wouldn't touch God's work".23 Eshaghian herself suggests that societal pressure and the desire to conform ("be like others") are major driving forces behind the high rate of SRS in Iran.22 This raises questions about whether the film primarily represents individuals freely choosing transition or those coerced by a repressive system into a specific medical path. Some later Iranian artists criticized such documentaries for creating "types" rather than complex characters, potentially fostering pity rather than understanding.45
The Gaze: The film's gaze is complex. While seemingly empathetic, its focus on the surgical process, consultations with doctors, and interviews with a cleric explaining the fatwa inevitably incorporates a medical and state-sanctioned perspective.22 The camera captures moments of distress and uncertainty, potentially aligning with a humanitarian gaze focused on suffering.32 The framing of transition as primarily a solution to the "problem" of same-sex desire, reinforced by both subjects' statements and the director's interpretation, risks solidifying a pathologized view of trans identity tied specifically to the Iranian context.
Socio-Cultural Engagement: Be Like Others powerfully illustrates the profound impact of family acceptance or rejection on the post-transition lives of its subjects.22 It clearly depicts the state's role through interviews with the cleric justifying the fatwa (arguing that since SRS wasn't mentioned in the 8th-century Quran, it cannot be a sin) and the surgeon discussing the procedure.22 The film documents the reality of the Iranian system but offers limited explicit critique, focusing more on the personal journeys within that system. The fact that it was made by an Iranian-American filmmaker and received awards at international festivals like Sundance and Berlin suggests it was aimed significantly at a Western audience, potentially shaping its representational choices.22
Specific Insights: Be Like Others offers a crucial, albeit potentially troubling, glimpse into how Iran's unique legal and religious framework shapes transgender lives and choices. It starkly reveals a situation where state-sanctioned surgery becomes a pathway—perhaps the only perceived pathway—for some individuals to align their bodies with their identities or, arguably, to escape persecution for non-normative gender expression or same-sex desire under the guise of a "curable" condition.22 The film implicitly raises profound questions about agency, coercion, and the ethics of a system that medicalizes identity as a means of social control, forcing individuals into potentially unwanted surgeries to "be like others" within a strict binary framework.23
C. Analysis 3: Leila (2023, Afghanistan/Sweden)
Synopsis & Context: Leila is a short documentary directed by Fariba Haidari, offering a portrait of its eponymous subject: a 64-year-old transgender woman and schoolteacher living in Herat, Afghanistan.46 Filmed shortly before the Taliban regained control of the country in August 2021, the film captures Leila navigating her life in an already antagonistic environment, showcasing her resilience, charm, and artistry while hinting at past traumas.46 The film's context is one of extreme precarity, underscored by the imminent political shift that threatens the fragile existence of individuals like Leila.49
Theoretical Application: This analysis emphasizes representation under duress, resilience, intersectionality (age, gender identity, location, political instability), and the ethics of documentary voice in a high-risk context.
Detailed Analysis:
Narrative & Character: Presented as "poignant and touching slices of Leila’s life" 48, the short film adopts a portraiture approach. It constructs Leila as a complex and compelling survivor.46 She is shown actively negotiating her place in society, using her "irresistible charm and indispensable social skills".46 While acknowledging a "heavy past" and the scars of abuse, the film emphasizes her refusal to hide her identity and her ability to "relish life".46 Her identity as an older transgender woman provides a perspective often absent in media representations.
Cinematic Techniques: As a short documentary, the film likely relies on concise storytelling, potentially combining observational footage of Leila's daily life (teaching, interacting in Herat) with interview segments. The visual portrayal would be crucial in conveying both the beauty and fragility of her existence against the backdrop of Herat.
Socio-Cultural Engagement: The film offers a snapshot of life in Herat just before the Taliban's return, capturing a moment of precarious hope.49 It reportedly shows Leila interacting with other marginalized community members, such as children with disabilities and girls attending school, subtly weaving her story into a broader social fabric under threat.49 The knowledge of the impending Taliban takeover hangs heavy over the narrative, framing Leila's resilience with a sense of foreboding and highlighting the devastating consequences of the international withdrawal and Taliban resurgence for vulnerable populations.46
Representation & Voice: Leila aims to give voice to its subject, presenting her story with strength and courage.49 By focusing on her personality and daily life, it likely avoids sensationalizing her identity or experiences. The film acts as a powerful testament to individual endurance in the face of systemic adversity and political catastrophe. Its existence is a form of resistance and an urgent reminder of the human cost of political events.49
Specific Insights: Leila functions as a vital, time-sensitive document capturing transgender existence within a context of extreme political instability and social conservatism. It underscores the profound precarity faced by trans individuals under oppressive regimes. While celebrating Leila's individual resilience and spirit, the film is inevitably shadowed by the impending loss of freedoms and safety, raising critical ethical questions about the responsibility of representation and the international community's failure to protect vulnerable Afghans.49 It highlights that trans lives exist and persist even in the most challenging circumstances, demanding recognition and solidarity.
(Optional) Comparative Note on A Jihad for Love (2007)
Parvez Sharma's earlier documentary A Jihad for Love (2007) took a broader approach, exploring the lives of lesbian, gay, and transgender Muslims across twelve countries.50 Its title intentionally reclaims the Islamic concept of "jihad" as an "inner struggle" against the dominant media narrative of holy war.52 The film aimed to challenge monolithic views of Islam by showcasing devout Muslims grappling with the intersection of their faith and their sexual orientation or gender identity.55 It included transgender individuals within its scope, presenting their struggles alongside those of gay and lesbian Muslims.50 However, the film faced criticism for its representational choices, such as the extensive use of silhouettes and covered faces to protect subjects' identities, which some felt reinforced shame.51 Furthermore, its broad scope might risk homogenizing diverse experiences across vastly different cultural and national contexts. From a critical perspective informed by scholars like Jasbir Puar or Joseph Massad (though not directly cited in snippets, their critiques of "homonationalism" and sexual humanitarianism are relevant here), the film could be analyzed for potentially aligning with a framework of "sexual humanitarianism".34 By framing subjects primarily through their struggle and quest for acceptance within a Western-legible rights discourse, it might inadvertently fit into narratives that position the West as the ultimate arbiter of sexual liberation, potentially overlooking complex local dynamics or forms of resistance.34 Its inclusion of trans experiences within a wider LGBTQ+ Muslim frame was significant for visibility, but requires analysis regarding how specific trans narratives were integrated and potentially subsumed under broader queer Muslim identities.

V. Synthesis: Patterns and Divergences in Representation
Analyzing the case studies alongside the broader context reveals recurring patterns, significant variations, and complex engagements with socio-political realities in the representation of transgender themes within MENA cinema.

A. Common Tropes and Thematic Concerns
Several thematic concerns appear frequently in the limited corpus of films addressing transgender issues in the region. The struggle with family and society is a dominant motif, as seen in the intense familial opposition faced by Edi in Facing Mirrors and the varying degrees of acceptance and rejection experienced by the subjects in Be Like Others.22 This reflects the reality that even where legal pathways exist, social stigma and the weight of family expectations remain immense hurdles.21

Films often grapple directly with the role of the state and law. Facing Mirrors and Be Like Others are inextricably linked to Iran's specific fatwa-based legal framework, exploring its implications for individual lives.22 Leila, conversely, is framed by the imminent collapse of state structures and the rise of a regime actively hostile to gender diversity.46 This highlights how cinematic narratives are often shaped by, and respond to, the particular configurations of state power and legal recognition (or lack thereof).

The tension between medicalization and identity is particularly pronounced in the Iranian examples. The focus on SRS in Be Like Others underscores a system where transition is framed primarily as a medical procedure, potentially overshadowing or even coercing individual identity formation.9 Facing Mirrors also centers on the pursuit of surgery, though perhaps more clearly driven by the protagonist's internal sense of self amidst external pressures.37

Intersectionality, while not always explicitly theorized within the films themselves, consistently shapes the characters' experiences. Class differences are central to the dynamic in Facing Mirrors.37 Age is a key factor in Leila's unique perspective.46 The political context of impending regime change defines the stakes in Leila 49, while the backdrop of state repression informs the choices made in Be Like Others.23 Religion is a constant undercurrent, influencing both state policies and personal beliefs.3

Despite the often-daunting circumstances depicted, narratives frequently emphasize resilience and agency. Edi's determination to escape and define his own life in Facing Mirrors 42 and Leila's persistence and charm in navigating a hostile environment 46 showcase protagonists actively shaping their destinies, resisting simplistic narratives of victimhood.

B. Variations Across Genres, Nations, and Time
Differences in genre significantly impact representation. The narrative structure of Facing Mirrors allows for deliberate character development and thematic exploration through fictionalized encounters, potentially offering more space for portraying agency and complex interpersonal dynamics.42 Documentaries like Be Like Others and Leila, conversely, carry the weight of representing real lives under specific, often difficult, conditions.23 Their claim to authenticity brings different ethical considerations and potential gazes (medical, humanitarian) into play.

National context is paramount. The Iranian films analyzed are deeply embedded in the country's unique legal framework regarding SRS, producing narratives focused on transition, medical processes, and the distinction from homosexuality. Films emerging from contexts without such frameworks, or where criminalization is the primary reality (like Afghanistan under the Taliban, Morocco, or Tunisia), would likely explore different themes—perhaps focusing more on clandestine existence, migration, activism, or navigating daily life under constant threat. The brief mention of The Blue Caftan (Morocco, 2022) suggests explorations of queer desire within localized networks, potentially diverging from transition-focused narratives.11

While the sample is small, comparing Be Like Others (2008) with Leila (2023) suggests potential shifts. Leila's focus on an older subject and its poignant capture of a specific political moment offers a different kind of narrative urgency compared to the process-oriented focus of Be Like Others. More research is needed to determine if broader temporal trends exist in how MENA cinema engages with trans themes and global discourses.

C. Challenging vs. Reinforcing Norms
MENA films featuring transgender characters inherently challenge cisnormativity and heteronormativity simply by centering lives often rendered invisible or pathologized. They bring transgender experiences into public discourse, potentially fostering empathy and understanding.40

However, they can also inadvertently reinforce certain norms. The strong focus on binary (male-to-female or female-to-male) transitions in the Iranian films analyzed reflects the limitations of the legal framework, which does not easily accommodate non-binary identities.9 This focus might unintentionally reinforce a binary understanding of gender. Similarly, the emphasis on medical processes and suffering in some documentaries, while reflecting reality, could reinforce pathologizing views if not handled critically.45 The pressure depicted in Be Like Others for individuals to transition to conform to heterosexual norms after surgery (to "be like others") highlights how even sanctioned transition can be co-opted to uphold heteronormativity.22

Audience reception is also a critical factor. A film like Facing Mirrors, celebrated internationally for its bravery, might be interpreted within Iran through the lens of its specific engagement with local social dynamics and class issues.42 Documentaries aimed at international audiences might be received as exposés of human rights abuses, potentially overlooking nuances understood by local viewers.22

D. The Politics of Visibility in MENA Trans Cinema
The act of making transgender lives visible through cinema in the MENA region is inherently political and fraught with complexity. Visibility can be a tool for empowerment, challenging societal silence and demanding recognition.34 Films like Facing Mirrors and Leila offer powerful portraits of resilience that can foster empathy and solidarity.42

However, visibility also carries significant risks. In contexts where gender non-conformity is criminalized or heavily stigmatized, increased visibility can lead to backlash, harassment, and violence against both the subjects depicted and the broader community.17 Filmmakers must navigate serious ethical considerations regarding the safety and representation of their subjects, particularly in documentaries.22

Furthermore, the international circulation of these films introduces another layer of complexity related to the geopolitics of representation. Films depicting LGBTQ+ lives in MENA countries are often received in the West through pre-existing frameworks that may emphasize narratives of oppression, victimhood, and the need for Western intervention or validation.34 This can lead to films being celebrated for their perceived political bravery against "repressive regimes," sometimes overshadowing nuanced artistic merit or complex social commentary.40 There is a risk that such reception reinforces Orientalist tropes of the "oppressed Muslim" or fits neatly into a "sexual humanitarianism" discourse that focuses on individual suffering rather than systemic issues or local forms of resistance.34 The way Facing Mirrors was received internationally versus the critique of Circumstance as potentially playing to Orientalist fantasies illustrates this tension.42 Similarly, the international festival success of Be Like Others suggests its narrative resonated with global human rights concerns, but its interpretation must consider the specific pressures of the Iranian context it depicts.22 The meaning and impact of visibility are therefore highly context-dependent, negotiated between filmmaker intent, local realities, and the geopolitical lenses through which international audiences often view the MENA region.

VI. Conclusion: Reflections and Future Directions
A. Summary of Findings
This examination of transgender representation in Middle Eastern and North African cinema reveals a landscape marked by scarcity, complexity, and contradiction. The socio-legal terrain varies dramatically across the region, ranging from contexts where transition is conditionally permitted within a medicalized framework (Iran) to those where vague morality laws enable arbitrary persecution (Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia) and situations of extreme precarity under hostile regimes (Afghanistan). Films navigating these contexts often foreground themes of family conflict, state negotiation, resilience, and the tension between imposed norms and individual identity.

Applying intersecting frameworks from trans studies and film theory illuminates how these films construct meaning. Narrative features like Facing Mirrors utilize character development and plot to explore agency and empathy across social divides, challenging simplistic victim narratives. Documentaries like Be Like Others provide intimate access to lived experiences within specific systems, raising critical questions about coercion and medicalization, while films like Leila capture poignant moments of existence under duress. Common threads emerge, including the centrality of family, the inescapable influence of state power, and the constant negotiation of identity. However, variations in genre, national context, and potentially time lead to diverse representational strategies. While these films challenge cisnormativity by centering trans lives, they sometimes risk reinforcing binary norms or pathologizing views, depending on their specific focus and framing. The politics of visibility remain complex, with potential benefits of awareness weighed against risks of backlash and the geopolitical dynamics influencing international reception.

B. Broader Implications
The study of MENA trans cinema makes valuable contributions to several fields. For Transgender Studies, it offers crucial perspectives from beyond the predominantly Western focus, highlighting diverse ways trans identities are understood, lived, and regulated within different cultural, religious, and legal systems. It complicates universalizing theories by demonstrating the impact of specific local contexts, such as the unique role of religious fatwas or colonial legal legacies. For Film Studies, it provides new ground for applying and potentially refining theories of representation, gaze, narrative, and genre in relation to marginalized identities within non-Western cinematic traditions. For MENA Studies, analyzing these films offers insights into contemporary social issues, the negotiation of tradition and modernity, the impact of state policies on intimate lives, and the role of cultural production in reflecting and shaping social change. Critically engaging with these films requires sensitivity and ethical awareness from scholars and audiences alike, recognizing the vulnerabilities of the subjects and communities represented.

C. Limitations and Avenues for Future Research
This study is necessarily limited by the relatively small number of readily accessible feature films explicitly addressing transgender themes from the MENA region. The analysis heavily features Iranian cinema due to its unique context generating more visible (though specific) representations related to SRS. Future research should actively seek out and analyze a wider range of productions, including short films, web series, independent and experimental works, which may offer different perspectives.46 Investigating films where trans themes might be coded or explored more subtly within broader queer narratives (e.g., The Blue Caftan 11) is also essential.

Further research is needed on audience reception within MENA countries to understand how these films are interpreted locally, beyond international festival circuits. Studies focusing on the experiences and perspectives of transgender filmmakers, actors, and cultural practitioners from the region would provide invaluable insights into agency and creative processes. Comparative analyses, placing MENA trans cinema in dialogue with representations from other non-Western regions (such as South Asia, Latin America, or other parts of Africa, as suggested by the scope of work in 10), could reveal broader global patterns and specificities. Finally, dedicated research into the representation (or lack thereof) of non-binary identities in MENA media is crucial, as current representations appear overwhelmingly focused on binary transitions, reflecting both societal norms and, in some cases, restrictive legal frameworks.20 Expanding the scope and depth of research in these areas will be vital for a more comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of transgender representation in Middle Eastern and North African cinema.
