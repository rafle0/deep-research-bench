Therapeutic Modulation of Metal Ions in Cardiovascular Disease
Introduction
Trace and major metal ions play critical roles in cardiovascular physiology, and imbalances in these minerals have been linked to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Both deficiency and excess of certain metals can contribute to oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, arrhythmogenesis, and other pathogenic processes ([Copper ions: The invisible killer of cardiovascular disease (Review)](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2024.13334#:~:text=Copper acts as a catalyst,While there is a)) ([Frontiers | Genetic insights into the effect of trace elements on cardiovascular diseases: multi-omics Mendelian randomization combined with linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1459465/full#:~:text=match at L834 have demonstrated,Therefore%2C maintaining an appropriate)). This has led to exploration of interventions – such as dietary supplementation, intravenous replacement, or chelation therapy – to modulate plasma metal ion levels for CVD prevention and treatment. Below, we review key metal ions (iron, copper, zinc, magnesium, calcium, selenium, etc.), the interventions proposed to alter their levels, and the evidence for efficacy in preventing or treating CVD. Both preventive strategies (e.g. dietary changes or supplements in at-risk populations) and therapeutic approaches (e.g. treating deficiency in heart failure, removing excess metals) are addressed, with evidence drawn from clinical trials, observational studies, and mechanistic research.

Iron Interventions in CVD
Biological Rationale: Iron is essential for oxygen transport and cardiac muscle metabolism, but its homeostasis is a double-edged sword. Iron deficiency can impair cardiac function (even before anemia develops), whereas iron overload may catalyze oxidative injury ([Frontiers | Genetic insights into the effect of trace elements on cardiovascular diseases: multi-omics Mendelian randomization combined with linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1459465/full#:~:text=Iron plays an indispensable role,reactions%2C cell growth%2C maintenance%2C and)) ([Frontiers | Genetic insights into the effect of trace elements on cardiovascular diseases: multi-omics Mendelian randomization combined with linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1459465/full#:~:text=1,Retinol displays a notable)). In CVD, iron imbalance is common – for example, many heart failure (HF) patients have iron deficiency, and some individuals have high iron stores that were hypothesized to promote atherosclerosis.

Iron Supplementation (Deficiency): In patients with HF and iron deficiency, correcting the deficiency with intravenous (IV) iron has emerged as a beneficial therapy. Multiple randomized trials (e.g. FAIR-HF, CONFIRM-HF, AFFIRM-AHF) and meta-analyses show that IV iron (typically ferric carboxymaltose) improves exercise capacity, symptoms, and reduces HF hospitalizations ([Intravenous iron in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency: an updated meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36823953/#:~:text=Aims%3A For patients with,outcomes in patients with HF)) ([Intravenous iron in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency: an updated meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36823953/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A In patients with,cause mortality remains inconclusive)). A 2023 meta-analysis of 10 trials (3,373 patients) found IV iron therapy significantly lowered the risk of recurrent HF hospitalizations by 25% and first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death by ~28% ([Intravenous iron in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency: an updated meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36823953/#::text=included,cause mortality (OR)). While a mortality benefit has not been clearly demonstrated (trials were not powered for mortality), the reduction in morbidity is well-supported ([Intravenous iron in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency: an updated meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36823953/#:~:text=Aims%3A

Iron Reduction (Overload): Conversely, the "iron hypothesis" posited that reducing high-normal iron stores might protect against atherosclerosis by lowering iron-driven oxidative stress ([Reduction of iron stores and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with peripheral arterial disease: a randomized controlled trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17299195/#:~:text=Context%3A Accumulation of iron,mediated oxidative stress)). This was tested in the Iron and Atherosclerosis Trial (FeAST), where patients with peripheral arterial disease were randomized to periodic phlebotomy (to reduce iron stores) vs. no phlebotomy. After 5 years, iron reduction achieved lower ferritin levels but did not significantly improve outcomes: all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events were similar between groups ([Reduction of iron stores and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with peripheral arterial disease: a randomized controlled trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17299195/#::text=Results%3A There were no,1.07%3B P %3D .20)) ([Reduction of iron stores and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with peripheral arterial disease: a randomized controlled trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17299195/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A Reduction of body,nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke)). All-cause death occurred in 20% of the phlebotomy group vs. 23% controls (HR 0.85, p=0.17), and there was no significant difference in the composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke ([Reduction of iron stores and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with peripheral arterial disease: a randomized controlled trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17299195/#:~:text=Results%3A

Copper Modulation Strategies
Biological Rationale: Copper is a trace element required for cardiac enzymes (e.g. cytochrome c oxidase, superoxide dismutase) and for cross-linking of collagen/elastin in the heart and vessels. Both copper excess and deficiency can adversely affect the cardiovascular system ([Copper ions: The invisible killer of cardiovascular disease (Review)](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2024.13334#:~:text=Copper acts as a catalyst,While there is a)). Severe copper deficiency (rare in humans, but seen in malnourishment or post-bariatric surgery) can cause anemia, connective tissue abnormalities, and potentially cardiomyopathy. On the other hand, excess copper can generate oxidative stress and cell toxicity – recently, “copper-induced cell death” (cuproptosis) has been implicated in CVD pathogenesis ([Copper ions: The invisible killer of cardiovascular disease (Review)](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2024.13334#:~:text=forms of cell death such,copper imbalances through approaches such)) ([Copper ions: The invisible killer of cardiovascular disease (Review)](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2024.13334#:~:text=Copper

Copper Supplementation (Deficiency): In the general population, true copper deficiency is uncommon; thus, routine copper supplementation for CVD prevention is not widely studied. Ensuring a normal dietary intake of copper (from vegetables, nuts, meats, etc.) is important for cardiovascular health, but beyond that there is little evidence that extra copper helps those with adequate levels. Some animal studies suggest copper supplementation can improve cardiac function in diet-induced copper deficiency, but in humans this has not translated into any specific CVD therapy. The main scenario requiring copper repletion is acquired deficiency (which can present with anemia and perhaps cardiovascular effects).

Copper Chelation (Excess): Therapeutic interest has focused on reducing copper in conditions of copper overload or dysregulation. The classic example is Wilson’s disease (extreme copper excess causing liver and neurologic injury), where copper chelating agents (penicillamine, trientine) prevent organ damage, including Wilson’s-associated cardiomyopathy. Beyond Wilson’s, researchers have investigated copper chelation in more common cardiac conditions: for instance, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and heart failure. Rationale: excess tissue copper may contribute to pathological remodeling (via profibrotic enzyme activity like lysyl oxidase). In a pilot study of 20 patients with HCM, 6 months of oral trientine (a Cu²⁺ chelator) was safe and led to a reduction in left ventricular mass and fibrosis compared to controls ([Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35169044/#:~:text=Results%3A Trientine treatment was,04) as opposed to pure)) ([Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35169044/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A Cu 2%2B,2b trial is now underway)). Global strain and diastolic function improved, suggesting copper reduction might partially reverse HCM changes ([Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35169044/#:~:text=Results%3A

Outside of these experimental uses, the principal therapeutic approach for copper excess remains chelation. Agents like trientine, tetrathiomolybdate (another investigational chelator), and even EDTA can bind copper ([Copper ions: The invisible killer of cardiovascular disease (Review)](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2024.13334#:~:text=encompass a wide range of,carriers and natural antidote agents)). Chelation must be used cautiously – copper is needed for normal physiology, and indiscriminate chelation can remove other metals as well ([Copper ions: The invisible killer of cardiovascular disease (Review)](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2024.13334#:~:text=physiologically and pathophysiologically (179),copper regulation using copper ion)). At this time, copper modulation is not a routine CVD therapy, but it is a promising research avenue for conditions with copper dysregulation. Maintaining copper balance is important: some reviews dub copper ions an “invisible killer” in CVD when in excess ([Copper ions: The invisible killer of cardiovascular disease (Review)](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2024.13334#:~:text=significance of maintaining copper homeostasis,their limitations and future prospects)), yet too little copper is also detrimental. Future strategies might involve both copper chelators and copper-binding carriers to fine-tune copper levels ([Copper ions: The invisible killer of cardiovascular disease (Review)](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2024.13334#:~:text=chelating agents%3B however%2C alternative methods,17)).

Zinc and Cardiovascular Health
Biological Rationale: Zinc is an essential trace element with broad antioxidant and anti-inflammatory roles. It is a cofactor for numerous enzymes and transcription factors, including the antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Adequate zinc supports endothelial function (by regulating nitric oxide synthase), stabilizes cell membranes, and modulates ion channels and immune responses ([Frontiers | Genetic insights into the effect of trace elements on cardiovascular diseases: multi-omics Mendelian randomization combined with linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1459465/full#:~:text=cardiovascular system%2C zinc promotes vasodilation,by minimizing free radical damage)). Zinc promotes vasodilation (by affecting TRP channels and inhibiting calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle) and helps reduce oxidative stress in cardiovascular tissues ([Frontiers | Genetic insights into the effect of trace elements on cardiovascular diseases: multi-omics Mendelian randomization combined with linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1459465/full#:~:text=cardiovascular

Zinc Supplementation (Deficiency or Preventive Use): Large segments of the population, especially in low-income regions, have suboptimal zinc intake ([Frontiers | Zinc as a Biomarker of Cardiovascular Health](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.686078/full#:~:text=deaths (4). CVD,and CVD mortality%2C in)). Observational studies show associations between low zinc status and higher rates of coronary artery disease, heart failure, and cardiac death ([Frontiers | Zinc as a Biomarker of Cardiovascular Health](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.686078/full#:~:text=between Zn intake and Zn,6)) ([Frontiers | Zinc as a Biomarker of Cardiovascular Health](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.686078/full#:~:text=carbohydrate metabolism%2C and negatively impacts,deficiency are adversely linked to)). In cohort analyses, higher dietary zinc consumption has been linked to reduced CVD risk ([Frontiers | Zinc as a Biomarker of Cardiovascular Health](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.686078/full#:~:text=Cohort studies%2C randomized trials%2C and,that supports cardiac steam cell)), with some studies suggesting an L-shaped relationship (benefit plateaus or reverses at very high intakes) ([Frontiers | Genetic insights into the effect of trace elements on cardiovascular diseases: multi-omics Mendelian randomization combined with linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1459465/full#:~:text=injury (92),94)). Zinc supplementation has been tested mostly for intermediate risk factors. A systematic review (GRADE analysis) indicates that zinc supplementation can favorably affect cardiovascular risk factors – improving glycemic control, lipid profiles, and lowering inflammation markers in some populations ([L-shaped association between dietary zinc intake and the risk of ...](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1032048/full#:~:text=,the development of cardiovascular)). For example, trials in patients with type 2 diabetes have shown improved HbA1c with zinc, and meta-analyses suggest supplemental zinc may slightly reduce incidence of type 2 diabetes in those at risk ([Micronutrient Supplementation to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk - JACC](https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2022.09.048#:~:text=Micronutrient Supplementation to Reduce Cardiovascular,dose of 160 mg)) ([Serum Zinc Level and Coronary Heart Disease Events in Patients ...](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/30/3/523/25499/Serum-Zinc-Level-and-Coronary-Heart-Disease-Events#:~:text=Theoretically%2C our results are in,in preventing atherosclerotic complications)). Since diabetes and dyslipidemia are major CVD drivers, these effects are indirectly cardioprotective. Some small trials and animal studies also indicate zinc can aid myocardial healing after injury and reduce arrhythmias ([Frontiers | Zinc as a Biomarker of Cardiovascular Health](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.686078/full#:~:text=Cohort

Despite these positive signals, no large clinical trial has conclusively shown that zinc supplementation alone prevents heart attacks or strokes. The results across studies are somewhat inconsistent ([Frontiers | Genetic insights into the effect of trace elements on cardiovascular diseases: multi-omics Mendelian randomization combined with linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1459465/full#:~:text=injury (92),94)). Notably, excessive zinc intake can cause copper deficiency (via competitive absorption) and possibly increase cardiovascular risk if taken to extremes ([Frontiers | Genetic insights into the effect of trace elements on cardiovascular diseases: multi-omics Mendelian randomization combined with linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1459465/full#:~:text=0,Vitamin B6 demonstrates negative causal)). A recent Mendelian randomization analysis even suggested that very high zinc intake might raise risk of arrhythmia (cardiac arrest) ([Frontiers | Genetic insights into the effect of trace elements on cardiovascular diseases: multi-omics Mendelian randomization combined with linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1459465/full#:~:text=0

Magnesium in Cardiovascular Disease
Biological Rationale: Magnesium is a major mineral (electrolyte) crucial for cardiovascular function. It is a natural calcium antagonist that modulates vascular tone, cardiac electrophysiology, and platelet function. Adequate magnesium causes vasodilation and anti-arrhythmic effects, whereas magnesium deficiency can lead to hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and electrical instability of the heart. Low serum magnesium has been associated with higher risks of atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, hypertension, stroke, and heart failure in epidemiological studies ([Frontiers | Genetic insights into the effect of trace elements on cardiovascular diseases: multi-omics Mendelian randomization combined with linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1459465/full#:~:text=genetic correlation between iron and,genetic correlation with paroxysmal tachycardia)) ([Dietary magnesium intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality: a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27927203/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A Increasing dietary magnesium,magnesium might provide health benefits)). On the other hand, high dietary magnesium intake may protect against these conditions.

Dietary Magnesium and Prevention: Higher magnesium intake is consistently linked with lower cardiovascular risk in observational research. A meta-analysis of 40 prospective cohort studies (>1 million participants) found that increasing dietary magnesium is associated with reduced risk of stroke, heart failure, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality ([Dietary magnesium intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality: a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27927203/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A Increasing dietary magnesium,magnesium might provide health benefits)). Notably, each 100 mg/day increment in magnesium intake was associated with a significant decrease in stroke risk and HF risk, though the meta-analysis did not find a significant association with coronary heart disease incidence ([Dietary magnesium intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality: a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27927203/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A

Therapeutic Magnesium (Acute Settings): Magnesium has well-established acute uses in cardiovascular care. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is a first-line therapy for the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia torsades de pointes (to normalize heart rhythm). It is also routinely given to prevent arrhythmias after cardiac surgery and during acute management of preeclampsia to prevent seizures (showing its vascular stabilizing effect). In acute myocardial infarction (MI), earlier small trials (e.g. LIMIT-2 in the 1990s) suggested IV magnesium given immediately could reduce mortality, presumably by limiting arrhythmias and myocardial injury. However, a large definitive trial (ISIS-4, 58,000 patients) found no survival benefit to routine IV magnesium post-MI (ISIS-4: A randomised factorial trial assessing early oral captopril ...90865-X/fulltext#::text=Magnesium There was no significant,1)) (Magnesium in acute myocardial infarction - TheLancet.com26004-6/fulltext#::text=Magnesium in acute myocardial infarction,control). Of these)). ISIS-4 reported no significant difference in 5-week mortality between the magnesium group (7.6%) and placebo (~7.2%), indicating magnesium did not improve outcomes in the era of modern reperfusion therapy. Thus, IV magnesium is not recommended for all MI patients, but it remains indicated if there is documented hypomagnesemia or specific arrhythmias.

Chronic Magnesium Supplementation (Therapy): In chronic heart failure, magnesium deficiency is common (due to diuretics and poor nutrition) and can exacerbate arrhythmias. Supplementing magnesium in deficient HF patients can reduce ventricular ectopy and muscle cramps, though outcome trials are lacking. In atrial fibrillation, some evidence suggests oral magnesium may help prevent recurrence in combination with standard drugs, but data are not robust. For preventive cardiology, maintaining normal magnesium through diet or supplements is low-risk and potentially beneficial. Magnesium supplements up to 400 mg daily are generally safe; toxicity is rare except in severe renal impairment. Overall, magnesium repletion is a well-established supportive therapy: it clearly prevents arrhythmias in acute care and likely prevents stroke and HF when taken adequately in the diet ([Dietary magnesium intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality: a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27927203/#::text=Conclusions%3A Increasing dietary magnesium,magnesium might provide health benefits)). Given its safety and the epidemiologic evidence, strategies to improve magnesium intake (dietary counseling or supplements) are often recommended as part of a heart-healthy lifestyle.

Calcium and Cardiovascular Interventions
Biological Rationale: Calcium is ubiquitous in cardiovascular physiology – it mediates muscle contraction (including heart and vascular smooth muscle), neuronal signaling, and more. However, calcium’s role in CVD is complex. Disturbed calcium homeostasis can contribute to hypertension (excess vascular tone), and calcium deposits in arterial walls are a hallmark of atherosclerosis (arterial calcification). Many patients (especially older women) take calcium supplements for bone health, raising questions about potential cardiovascular effects of calcium supplementation. High serum calcium or hyperparathyroidism has been linked to vascular calcification and cardiac arrhythmias, whereas very low calcium can cause cardiac depressions and QT prolongation. Most concern has centered on whether calcium supplementation increases CVD risk by accelerating vascular calcification or triggering thrombotic events.

Calcium Supplementation and CVD Risk: Several large analyses have investigated the impact of calcium supplements (usually given for osteoporosis prevention) on cardiovascular outcomes. The data have been somewhat mixed, but some studies indicate that calcium supplements (particularly without vitamin D) may modestly increase the risk of MI. A 2010 meta-analysis by Bolland et al. of randomized trials (adding up to 12,000 participants) found that calcium supplements (≥500 mg/day) were associated with about a 20–30% increased risk of MI compared to placebo ([Effect of calcium supplements on risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events: meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20671013/#::text=allocated to calcium had a,038)) ([Effect of calcium supplements on risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events: meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20671013/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A Calcium supplements ,management of osteoporosis is warranted)). In that analysis, 143 people on calcium had an MI vs. 111 on placebo (HR 1.31, p≈0.03) ([Effect of calcium supplements on risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events: meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20671013/#::text=allocated

Chelation Therapy to Remove Vascular Calcium: Given that calcified plaques are a feature of coronary artery disease, an unconventional approach has been to use chelation therapy to bind and remove calcium and other metals from the body. EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) chelation can bind divalent and trivalent metal ions including Ca²⁺, lead, and iron. Intravenous EDTA chelation has been explored for decades as an alternative treatment for atherosclerosis. The largest trial to date, the NIH-funded Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT), tested a regimen of multiple EDTA infusions in post-MI patients. Notably, TACT showed a modest benefit: over 55 months, EDTA-treated patients had an 18% relative reduction in recurrent cardiovascular events compared to placebo, and a subgroup analysis found a 41% reduction in events among patients with diabetes ([In a Large Multicenter Trial, Chelation Therapy Did Not Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Events in Patients With Diabetes and a History of Heart Attack | NCCIH](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/research/research-results/in-a-large-multicenter-trial-chelation-therapy-did-not-reduce-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-patients-with-diabetes-and-a-history-of-heart-attack#:~:text=An NIH,second study%2C called Trial to)). These results were surprising (given prior smaller trials were negative) and generated cautious optimism, especially for diabetic patients who often have extensive arterial calcification. To validate this, a follow-up trial TACT2 focused on diabetic post-MI patients. The results of TACT2 (presented 2024) did not replicate the benefit – chelation therapy showed no significant reduction in the composite outcome (which occurred in 35% of both groups over 4 years) ([TACT2: Chelation Therapy Does Not Improve Post-MI Outcomes in Patients With DM - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Articles/2024/04/02/17/02/sun-945am-tact2-acc-2024#::text=Results showed that at a,1.16%3B p%3D0.53)). In TACT2, although blood lead levels dropped by 61% with EDTA (confirming it was removing metals), this did not translate to improved clinical outcomes ([TACT2: Chelation Therapy Does Not Improve Post-MI Outcomes in Patients With DM - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Articles/2024/04/02/17/02/sun-945am-tact2-acc-2024#:~:text=Results

In summary, for calcium: patients should avoid excessive supplemental calcium unless needed, and focus on balanced intake. In advanced atherosclerosis, experimental interventions like EDTA chelation targeting vascular calcium have at best equivocal evidence at this time. Standard therapies (statins, blood pressure control, etc.) remain far more effective for CVD risk reduction.

Selenium and Cardiovascular Disease
Biological Rationale: Selenium is a trace element crucial for the antioxidant defense system. It is a component of selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductase, which protect cells (including cardiomyocytes and endothelium) from oxidative damage (Supplementation with Selenium and Coenzyme Q10 Reduces Cardiovascular Mortality in Elderly with Low Selenium Status. A Secondary Analysis of a Randomised Clinical Trial | PLOS One). Low selenium status can impair these antioxidant enzymes, leading to elevated oxidative stress and inflammation – known contributors to atherosclerosis and heart failure. Extreme selenium deficiency causes a form of cardiomyopathy (Keshan disease, observed historically in low-selenium areas of China), highlighting selenium’s importance for cardiac muscle. Even mild deficiency might exacerbate heart failure or coronary disease progression. On the other hand, very high selenium intake can be toxic and has been linked in some studies to increased risk of diabetes. Therefore, the relationship between selenium and CVD appears U-shaped.

Selenium Supplementation (Preventive/Deficiency): Whether selenium supplements can prevent CVD has been tested in several trials, often in combination with other antioxidants. In regions with adequate selenium (e.g. the United States), trials have generally shown no cardiovascular benefit. The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer trial (NPC, 1980s-90s), which gave 200 µg/day selenium to over 1,000 Americans (baseline selenium 115 µg/L), found no significant effect on CVD events over ~7.6 years ([Effects of selenium supplementation on cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality: secondary analyses in a randomized clinical trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16495471/#::text=mortality through the entire blinded,were further stratified by tertiles)) ([Effects of selenium supplementation on cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality: secondary analyses in a randomized clinical trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16495471/#:~:text=cardiovascular disease endpoints during 7,cardiovascular disease in this population)). Hazard ratios for MI, stroke, and CVD mortality were approximately 1.0 (no difference) ([Effects of selenium supplementation on cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality: secondary analyses in a randomized clinical trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16495471/#:~:text=disease at baseline ,the primary prevention of cardiovascular)). Similarly, the large SELECT trial (Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial) in >35,000 men (baseline selenium 135 µg/L) showed no reduction in cardiovascular outcomes with selenium (200 µg/day) – if anything, there was a slight increase in incidence of diabetes in the selenium group (though mechanism unclear). In contrast, in low-selenium populations, supplementation shows promise. A landmark Swedish trial by Alehagen et al. studied 443 elderly individuals (mean selenium ~67 µg/L, which is considered low) randomized to selenium 200 µg + coenzyme Q10 vs placebo for 4 years. The results were striking: supplementation cut cardiovascular mortality by about 50% over the follow-up ([Supplementation with Selenium and Coenzyme Q10 Reduces Cardiovascular Mortality in Elderly with Low Selenium Status. A Secondary Analysis of a Randomised Clinical Trial | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157541#::text=concentration%2C those receiving placebo or,be found in this group)). Importantly, the benefit was confined to those with low baseline selenium – when analyzed by baseline level, participants with ≤85 µg/L saw significant mortality reductions, whereas those >85 µg/L had no benefit ([Supplementation with Selenium and Coenzyme Q10 Reduces Cardiovascular Mortality in Elderly with Low Selenium Status.

After 5 years, the group <85 µg/L on placebo had 24% CV mortality versus only 12% with selenium/Q10 (absolute risk reduction 12%) ([Supplementation with Selenium and Coenzyme Q10 Reduces Cardiovascular Mortality in Elderly with Low Selenium Status. A Secondary Analysis of a Randomised Clinical Trial | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157541#:~:text=concentration%2C

Beyond mortality, selenium supplementation might improve certain heart failure parameters. For example, a trial in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy (where oxidative stress and selenium deficiency may play a role, especially in areas like Nigeria) found that adding selenium (along with standard therapy) did not significantly change clinical outcomes at 6 months, but it did lead to improvement in heart failure symptoms (NYHA class) and a trend toward better ejection fraction ([Selenium supplementation in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy](https://bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12872-020-01739-z#:~:text=Selenium supplementation in patients with,was a trend towards)). This hints that selenium helped the myocardium recover functionally, even if the trial was underpowered for hard endpoints.

Current Perspective: Selenium repletion is clearly necessary in deficiency states to prevent cardiomyopathy (as evidenced by Keshan disease prevention with selenium in endemic areas). For the broader population, selenium supplementation alone is not a proven strategy to prevent heart attacks or strokes, especially in those already replete. However, in the subset with low selenium status, supplementation (potentially combined with other antioxidants like CoQ10) appears beneficial ([Supplementation with Selenium and Coenzyme Q10 Reduces Cardiovascular Mortality in Elderly with Low Selenium Status. A Secondary Analysis of a Randomised Clinical Trial | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157541#:~:text=In this evaluation of healthy,research on the impact of)). Given that selenium levels vary geographically (soil selenium content dictates dietary intake), population baseline matters. Europe has many regions of low selenium, whereas North America’s population is generally selenium-sufficient through diet. Ongoing research is examining selenium’s role in heart failure outcomes, oxidative stress markers, and gene–selenium interactions. For now, major guidelines do not recommend routine selenium supplements for CVD prevention, except to ensure at least adequate dietary intake. It’s reasonable to check selenium levels in patients with unexplained cardiomyopathy or in those from regions of known low selenium, and supplement if they are deficient. In summary, selenium is essential for cardiovascular health, and targeted supplementation can be preventive in selenium-deficient populations (moderate evidence), while providing no known benefit (and potential risks) in selenium-replete groups ([Effects of selenium supplementation on cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality: secondary analyses in a randomized clinical trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16495471/#:~:text=cardiovascular disease endpoints during 7,cardiovascular disease in this population)) ([Supplementation with Selenium and Coenzyme Q10 Reduces Cardiovascular Mortality in Elderly with Low Selenium Status.

Sodium and Potassium: Electrolyte Management for CVD
Although sodium (Na⁺) and potassium (K⁺) are often discussed as electrolytes rather than “trace metals,” they are major metal cations in plasma and their modulation is a cornerstone of CVD prevention. High sodium intake and inadequate potassium intake are well-established dietary risk factors for hypertension, which in turn is a leading cause of stroke, coronary disease, and heart failure. Unlike the trace minerals above, the interventions here are lifestyle-focused but profoundly impactful.

Sodium Reduction: Excess dietary salt (sodium chloride) leads to elevated blood pressure in many individuals (“salt-sensitive” hypertension) and contributes to arterial stiffness and left ventricular hypertrophy. Public health efforts to reduce sodium intake (e.g. cutting down processed foods) have been shown to lower population blood pressure levels and are projected to prevent CVD events. Clinical trials confirm that reducing sodium lowers blood pressure; for instance, the DASH-sodium trial demonstrated stepwise BP reductions with incremental sodium cuts in the diet. More directly, a large cluster RCT in rural China (SSaSS – Salt Substitute and Stroke Study) tested a sodium reduction strategy using a salt substitute (75% NaCl / 25% KCl) in 21,000 individuals at high risk (history of stroke or hypertension). Over ~5 years, stroke incidence was significantly lower with the salt substitute than with regular salt (29 vs 34 strokes per 1,000 person-years, p=0.006) ([Salt Substitute and Stroke Study - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2021/08/26/01/19/SSaSS#::text=Principal Findings%3A)). Major cardiovascular events were also reduced (49 vs 56 per 1,000 person-years, p<0.001) ([Salt Substitute and Stroke Study - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2021/08/26/01/19/SSaSS#:~:text=,in the salt substitute group)), as was all-cause mortality. This trial provides compelling evidence that **lowering sodium (and concurrently raising potassium) in the diet prevents strokes and heart attacks ([Salt Substitute and Stroke Study - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2021/08/26/01/19/SSaSS#:~:text=Principal
Potassium Supplementation/Diet: Potassium has an inverse relationship with blood pressure – high potassium intake promotes sodium excretion (natriuresis) and relaxes blood vessels. Diets rich in potassium (fruits, vegetables, legumes) are consistently associated with lower stroke risk and blood pressure. The same SSaSS trial mentioned above underscored potassium’s role: those on salt substitute not only ate less sodium but also consumed 20% more potassium, which likely contributed to the blood pressure and stroke reduction ([Salt Substitute and Stroke Study - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2021/08/26/01/19/SSaSS#::text=Principal Findings%3A)). In general, increasing dietary potassium is a highly recommended strategy for CVD prevention. For most individuals, the target is 3,500–4,700 mg potassium per day (achieved by abundant produce intake). Direct potassium supplementation (pills) is less commonly used for prevention (due to pill limits and GI side effects), but clinicians sometimes prescribe it to patients on diuretics to prevent hypokalemia. Maintaining a normal-high serum potassium (within physiological range) is important in patients with CVD: low potassium can precipitate arrhythmias and increase mortality in heart failure. On the therapeutic side, drugs that spare potassium (such as aldosterone antagonists like spironolactone) not only correct potassium loss but have powerful mortality benefits in heart failure – though their benefit is mostly via hormonal effects, not just potassium levels. Nevertheless, one mechanistic finding from genetic studies was that higher genetically-predicted potassium status causally reduces ischemic heart disease risk, possibly through modulating certain metabolic pathways ([Frontiers | Genetic insights into the effect of trace elements on cardiovascular diseases: multi-omics Mendelian randomization combined with linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1459465/full#::text=Result%3A Our findings indicated a,ischemic heart disease by lowering)) ([Frontiers | Genetic insights into the effect of trace elements on cardiovascular diseases: multi-omics Mendelian randomization combined with linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1459465/full#:~:text=genetic correlation between iron and,genetic correlation with paroxysmal tachycardia)).
In summary, dietary sodium and potassium modification is a proven, first-line intervention for CVD prevention (Level IA evidence for stroke prevention). Unlike the other metal ions, this is a population-wide recommendation: eat less salt and more potassium-rich foods. These changes are estimated to prevent millions of CVD deaths globally. Notably, this strategy doesn’t “target plasma sodium” per se (which remains tightly regulated around 140 mEq/L in healthy people), but it modulates body sodium balance and blood pressure. The clinical evidence – such as the salt substitute trial – confirms that such intervention can **significantly lower cardiovascular event rates ([Salt Substitute and Stroke Study - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2021/08/26/01/19/SSaSS#::text=Principal Findings%3A)) ([Salt Substitute and Stroke Study - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2021/08/26/01/19/SSaSS#:~:text=,in the salt substitute group))**.

Other Trace Metals and Chelation Considerations
Other metal ions have been studied to a lesser extent in CVD contexts:

Chromium: Chromium is a trace metal involved in glucose metabolism (as part of the chromodulin molecule that enhances insulin signaling). Some small trials and meta-analyses have examined chromium supplements for improving blood sugar and lipids in metabolic syndrome and diabetes. A meta-analysis in patients with diabetes showed modest improvements in glycemic control with chromium supplementation, which could indirectly reduce CVD risk factors ([The role of chromium supplementation in cardiovascular risk factors](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10559203/#:~:text=factors pmc,has been evidenced that)). Chromium might also have minor effects on weight and cholesterol. However, robust evidence linking chromium supplementation to fewer CVD events is lacking. It has been proposed as a therapy to mitigate risk factors like insulin resistance, but no guideline recommends chromium for CVD prevention at this time. Caution is warranted because high doses of certain chromium formulations can cause kidney or liver issues. Overall, the impact of chromium on CVD is still considered unproven, though ensuring adequate dietary chromium (found in whole grains, meats, vegetables) is reasonable for general health.
Lead, Cadmium and Heavy Metals: These toxic metals are environmental pollutants, not nutrients, but they significantly influence cardiovascular risk. Chronic exposure to low-level lead and cadmium has been associated with hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and stroke (Low-level lead exposure and mortality in US adults - TheLancet.com30025-2/fulltext#::text=TheLancet.com www.thelancet.com Low,disease mortality in the USA)). For example, a large U.S. cohort study found that “low-level environmental lead exposure is an important, but overlooked, risk factor for CVD mortality” (Low-level lead exposure and mortality in US adults - TheLancet.com30025-2/fulltext#::text=TheLancet.com
Other trace elements (Manganese, etc.): Manganese is a cofactor for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and is involved in metabolism. Deficiency of manganese is rare, and no direct cardiovascular intervention is based on manganese levels. Excess manganese (such as in certain occupational exposures) primarily causes neurological issues rather than CVD. Cobalt is another metal relevant mostly to vitamin B12 (cobalamin) – deficiency in B12 (and thus cobalt) can cause anemia and high homocysteine, which is a risk factor for CVD. Treating B12 deficiency is important for hematologic and neurologic health; whether it reduces CVD events (via homocysteine lowering) was tested in trials of B vitamins, which generally did not show a reduction in heart attacks or stroke despite lowering homocysteine. Thus, correcting B12 (cobalt) deficiency is necessary for many reasons, but not specifically to prevent CVD events (beyond correcting anemia).
Finally, broad multivitamin/multimineral supplementation has not demonstrated clear cardiovascular benefits in randomized trials. For instance, trials like the Physicians’ Health Study II found no significant difference in MI or stroke rates between multivitamin users and placebo over many years. This suggests that in well-nourished populations, routine supplementation of various minerals (at nutritional doses) does not further reduce CVD risk. Targeted therapy is more rational: address the deficiencies or excesses that are present in a given patient.

Conclusion
Modulating plasma metal ion concentrations can influence cardiovascular health, but the success of such interventions depends on the specific context of deficiency or excess and the strength of evidence for that strategy:

Robust, clinically adopted interventions include iron supplementation in iron-deficient heart failure, which improves symptoms and reduces hospitalizations ([Intravenous iron in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency: an updated meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36823953/#:~:text=Aims%3A For patients with,outcomes in patients with HF)) ([Intravenous iron in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency: an updated meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36823953/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A In patients with,cause mortality remains inconclusive)), and dietary sodium/potassium modification, which has a large impact on blood pressure and has been shown to prevent strokes and cardiac events ([Salt Substitute and Stroke Study - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2021/08/26/01/19/SSaSS#:~:text=Principal Findings%3A)) ([Salt Substitute and Stroke Study - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2021/08/26/01/19/SSaSS#:~:text=,in the salt substitute group)). Magnesium repletion is also standard care to prevent arrhythmias in at-risk patients and is part of healthy lifestyle recommendations (e.g. diets high in magnesium-rich foods).
Interventions with mixed or limited evidence include selenium supplementation – beneficial in low-selenium settings ([Supplementation with Selenium and Coenzyme Q10 Reduces Cardiovascular Mortality in Elderly with Low Selenium Status.

Experimental or niche interventions are copper chelation for conditions like HCM or diabetic cardiomyopathy (early trials show improved cardiac structure/function ([Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35169044/#:~:text=Results%3A Trientine treatment was,04) as opposed to pure)) ([Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35169044/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A Cu 2%2B,2b trial is now underway))) and heavy metal chelation in atherosclerotic disease (initial positive results ([In a Large Multicenter Trial, Chelation Therapy Did Not Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Events in Patients With Diabetes and a History of Heart Attack | NCCIH](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/research/research-results/in-a-large-multicenter-trial-chelation-therapy-did-not-reduce-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-patients-with-diabetes-and-a-history-of-heart-attack#:~:text=An NIH,second study%2C called Trial to)) were not confirmed by follow-up studies ([In a Large Multicenter Trial, Chelation Therapy Did Not Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Events in Patients With Diabetes and a History of Heart Attack | NCCIH](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/research/research-results/in-a-large-multicenter-trial-chelation-therapy-did-not-reduce-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-patients-with-diabetes-and-a-history-of-heart-attack#:~:text=More than one,percent drop in blood lead))). These therapies are intriguing but not yet part of routine practice.
In summary, therapeutic modulation of metal ions holds both preventative and therapeutic potential, particularly where a clear imbalance exists (deficiency or overload). Repleting what is deficient (iron, magnesium, selenium, zinc) can improve cardiovascular function and outcomes in those patients, while removing or reducing what is in excess (lead, copper in certain contexts, possibly iron in true overload) may alleviate toxic effects. However, interventions must be evidence-based: large clinical trials have sometimes failed to show expected benefits, reminding us that complex human biology can defy simple supplementation fixes. Table 1 (below) provides a summary of various metal ion interventions, their target outcomes, and the strength of evidence. Moving forward, personalized assessment of micronutrient status and careful targeting of interventions (e.g. treating identified deficiencies, avoiding indiscriminate supplementation) appear to be the most prudent strategy in leveraging metal ions for cardiovascular prevention and therapy.

Metal Ion	Intervention	Target Outcome / Rationale	Evidence Strength
Iron	– IV iron supplementation in HF patients with iron deficiency– Phlebotomy or iron chelation in iron overload	– Improve exercise capacity, symptoms, and reduce HF hospitalizations (by correcting iron-deficient cardiomyopathy)– Reduce oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in high iron states (the “iron hypothesis”)	Strong (for deficiency): Multiple RCTs in HFrEF show improved functional status and fewer HF hospitalizations ([Intravenous iron in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency: an updated meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36823953/#:~:text=Aims%3A For patients with,outcomes in patients with HF)) ([Intravenous iron in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency: an updated meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36823953/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A In patients with,cause mortality remains inconclusive)). Now guideline-recommended in iron-deficient HF.Weak (for excess): Large RCT in PAD showed no CVD event reduction from iron removal ([Reduction of iron stores and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with peripheral arterial disease: a randomized controlled trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17299195/#:~:text=Results%3A There were no,1.07%3B P %3D .20)) ([Reduction of iron stores and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with peripheral arterial disease: a randomized controlled trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17299195/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A Reduction of body,nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke)). Phlebotomy is beneficial only in true hemochromatosis (to prevent cardiomyopathy).
Copper	– Copper chelation (e.g. trientine) in copper-excess states or certain cardiomyopathies– Copper supplementation if deficiency (rare)	– Reduce pathological remodeling in heart failure or HCM (by lowering copper-driven fibrosis and oxidative stress)– Restore normal enzyme function in deficiency (prevent anemia, cardiomyopathy)	Preliminary (for excess): Small pilot studies in HCM showed reduced LV mass and fibrosis with chelation ([Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35169044/#:~:text=Results%3A Trientine treatment was,04) as opposed to pure)) ([Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35169044/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A Cu 2%2B,2b trial is now underway)); a phase 2 HF trial showed biomarker and exercise improvements ([Could Copper Chelation Benefit HFrEF? TRACER-HF Offers Mixed Clues
Zinc	– Oral zinc supplementation (dietary or high-dose) in those with low zinc or at high risk– Part of antioxidant combinations	– Improve endothelial function and reduce oxidative stress (via Zn-dependent enzymes)– Improve lipid and glucose metabolism (thus lowering risk factors)– Promote healing post-MI and stabilize arrhythmias (observed in some studies)	Moderate (risk factor improvement): RCT meta-analyses indicate zinc can modestly improve glycemic control and lipid profiles ([L-shaped association between dietary zinc intake and the risk of ...](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1032048/full#:~:text=,the development of cardiovascular)). Cohort studies link higher Zn intake to lower CVD risk ([Frontiers
Magnesium	– Oral magnesium supplementation (for prevention or to correct deficiency)– IV magnesium in acute care (MI, arrhythmia)– Diet high in magnesium (fruits, veggies, etc.)	– Lower blood pressure (vasodilation), improve insulin sensitivity, reduce stroke risk– Prevent arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, torsades de pointes, ventricular ectopy)– Improve muscle function in HF (if low Mg)	Strong (preventive): Consistent inverse association between dietary Mg and risk of stroke, HF, diabetes ([Dietary magnesium intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality: a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27927203/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A Increasing dietary magnesium,magnesium might provide health benefits)). Clinical trials show BP reduction with Mg and fewer strokes with high Mg diet (e.g. DASH). Mixed (acute MI): Earlier small trials positive, but large ISIS-4 trial showed no mortality benefit of routine IV Mg post-MI. Still standard for specific arrhythmias (torsades) – a life-saving therapy there.Strong (arrhythmia prophylaxis): IV Mg is routinely used to prevent AF post-cardiac surgery and correct low Mg in HF; evidence supports this practice (reduces arrhythmia incidence).
Calcium	– Limit high-dose calcium supplements (especially without Vitamin D)– EDTA chelation therapy (40 IV infusions) to remove arterial calcium (and heavy metals)	– Avoid potential increased risk of MI observed with calcium oversupplementation (preserve vascular health)– Reduce atherosclerotic plaque burden and vascular calcification via demineralization of plaques (and removal of toxic metals), thereby lowering recurrent events	Moderate (supplement risk): Meta-analysis of trials showed a 1.3-fold increase in MI risk with calcium supplements alone ([Effect of calcium supplements on risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events: meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20671013/#::text=allocated to calcium had a,038)) ([Effect of calcium supplements on risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events: meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20671013/#:~:text=(pooled relative risk 1.27%2C 95,038)). Controversial, but many experts advise caution with supplements in CVD patients. Getting calcium from diet preferred.Weak (chelation): The first TACT trial showed an 18% reduction in events (and 41% in diabetics) ([In a Large Multicenter Trial, Chelation Therapy Did Not Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Events in Patients With Diabetes and a History of Heart Attack
Selenium	– Oral selenium supplementation (often 100–200 µg/day) in populations or patients with low selenium levels– Combined selenium + antioxidant therapy (e.g. Se + Coenzyme Q10) in seniors	– Boost antioxidant defenses (GPx, etc.) to reduce oxidative injury to heart and vessels– Prevent selenium-deficiency cardiomyopathy and possibly improve survival in low-Se individuals– Improve outcomes in heart failure or thyroid dysfunction related to low Se	High (for deficiency syndromes): In regions of severe Se deficiency, supplementation prevents cardiomyopathy (Keshan disease). In peripartum cardiomyopathy, Se may aid recovery (some symptom improvement noted).Moderate (for low-normal Se): In a Swedish RCT, Se+CoQ10 cut CV mortality ~50% in elderly with low Se ([Supplementation with Selenium and Coenzyme Q10 Reduces Cardiovascular Mortality in Elderly with Low Selenium Status. A Secondary Analysis of a Randomised Clinical Trial
Sodium & Potassium (major electrolytes)	– Dietary salt (sodium) restriction– Increase potassium intake (dietary preferred, or salt substitutes KCl)	– Lower blood pressure, reduce hypertension incidence– Prevent strokes, heart failure, and kidney disease caused by high BP– Favorable electrolyte balance reduces arrhythmia risk (avoid hypokalemia)	Very Strong: Robust RCT evidence and public health data support this. E.g., replacing regular salt with K-enriched salt led to significant reductions in stroke, major CV events, and mortality ([Salt Substitute and Stroke Study - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2021/08/26/01/19/SSaSS#:~:text=Principal Findings%3A)) ([Salt Substitute and Stroke Study - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2021/08/26/01/19/SSaSS#:~:text=,in the salt substitute group)). Numerous trials show BP lowering with sodium reduction. Guidelines universally endorse <2–2.4g/day sodium and high potassium intake for CVD prevention. This is a cornerstone of preventive cardiology (level I evidence for stroke prevention).
Lead, Cadmium (toxic metals)	– Avoidance of exposure (regulation, lifestyle changes like no smoking)– Chelation therapy in cases of heavy metal poisoning or high body burden	– Reduce long-term risk of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and renal damage caused by these toxins– Possibly improve endothelial function and lower oxidative stress by removing metal ions that catalyze radical formation	Strong (epidemiological link): Many studies show even low lead/cadmium levels correlate with higher CVD risk (Low-level lead exposure and mortality in US adults - TheLancet.com30025-2/fulltext#::text=TheLancet.com www.thelancet.com Low,disease mortality in the USA)) ([EXPERT REACTION: Almost 1 in 3 cardiovascular deaths in the US ...](https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/almost-1-in-5-deaths-in-the-us-could-be-because-of-lead#::text=EXPERT REACTION%3A Almost 1 in,the USA each year%2C)). Public health measures to reduce exposure have clear benefits (e.g. less lead → lower population BP).Weak (therapeutic chelation): Aside from treating acute toxicity, no trial has definitively shown CVD event reduction by chelating these metals. TACT trials targeted lead/cadmium removal; first trial hinted benefit, second showed none ([In a Large Multicenter Trial, Chelation Therapy Did Not Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Events in Patients With Diabetes and a History of Heart Attack
