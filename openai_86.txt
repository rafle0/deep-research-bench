Manufacturing Technology Options for Hollow Motor Shafts in NEV Electric Drive Units
Introduction
New Energy Vehicles (NEVs), including modern electric and hybrid cars, demand high-performance motor shafts that are lightweight yet strong. A shift from solid to hollow rotor shafts has been driven by weight reduction needs ([NETFORM's Two-Piece Hollow Rotor Shaft - NETFORM](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/#:~:text=able to handle high rotational,to friction and heat generation)). Lighter shafts improve dynamic balance at high RPM and raise the shaft’s natural frequency, avoiding critical vibrations ([Hollow shaft - Felss](https://felss.com/en/anwendung/hollow-shaft/#:~:text=Hollow shafts transmit rotary movements,have a high natural frequency)). Additionally, hollow shafts allow routing of coolant through the center, enhancing motor cooling and reducing thermal losses ([NETFORM's Two-Piece Hollow Rotor Shaft - NETFORM](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/#:~:text=However%2C an additional benefit of,related losses in the motor)). The NEV motor shaft must handle high rotational speeds under heavy torque while maintaining structural integrity and minimizing energy losses ([NETFORM's Two-Piece Hollow Rotor Shaft - NETFORM](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/#:~:text=The correct design and quality,to friction and heat generation)). These requirements mean the manufacturing process must produce precise, high-strength hollow shafts with good surface finish and minimal defects.

A variety of manufacturing processes can create hollow shafts. Each method offers different trade-offs in terms of materials, cost-effectiveness at various production volumes, dimensional accuracy, mechanical properties, surface finish, and required post-processing. Below, we review the main forming and fabrication techniques for hollow motor shafts – from traditional machining of a solid bar to advanced forming processes – and compare their suitability for NEV electric drive applications. Key factors for each method are summarized, followed by a comparison table and recommendations of the optimal routes (or combinations of processes) for producing NEV hollow shafts.

Requirements for NEV Hollow Motor Shafts
Before examining manufacturing methods, it is useful to outline the performance and quality requirements for an electric drive unit’s hollow motor shaft:

Lightweight & High Strength: The shaft should be as light as possible (hollow design) to improve vehicle efficiency and dynamic response, but still exhibit high tensile strength and fatigue endurance to transmit torque reliably ([Automotive - EV Motor shaft - Industries - Tungaloy-NTK America, Inc.](https://tungaloy.com/us/industries/automotive_ev-motor-shaft/#:~:text=EV driving motors are required,shafts%2C so how to achieve)) ([Hollow shaft - Felss](https://felss.com/en/anwendung/hollow-shaft/#:~:text=Hollow shafts transmit rotary movements,have a high natural frequency)).
Dimensional Precision: Precise OD/ID and concentricity are crucial for balance at high RPM. Tight tolerances on bearing journals, gear interfaces, and splines are needed for smooth operation.
Smooth Surface Finish: Good surface finish (both inside and outside) reduces stress concentrations and improves fatigue life. It also assists in achieving proper fits (e.g. bearing seats) and minimizing friction losses.
Material and Heat Treatment: Common materials include medium/low-carbon alloy steels that can be case-hardened or quenched-and-tempered for wear resistance (e.g. carburizing steel for surface hardness with a tough core) ([Automotive - EV Motor shaft - Industries - Tungaloy-NTK America, Inc.](https://tungaloy.com/us/industries/automotive_ev-motor-shaft/#:~:text=Shafts are becoming hollow to,is also an important factor)). The manufacturing process must accommodate subsequent heat treatments (or impart desirable cold work strengthening).
Efficiency Considerations: The hollow design can also reduce magnetic losses (less bulk steel in the rotor) and allow internal oil cooling ([NETFORM's Two-Piece Hollow Rotor Shaft - NETFORM](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/#:~:text=However%2C an additional benefit of,related losses in the motor)). The process should preserve material properties or enhance them (grain refinement, work hardening) to meet performance targets.
Cost & Volume: NEV production volumes are rising. An optimal process for shafts should be cost-effective at the required scale – whether low-volume prototypes or mass production – and ideally maximize material utilization (minimizing scrap). Processes that eliminate welding seams (one-piece construction) are favored to avoid stress risers and extra inspection, unless a multi-piece approach yields other benefits (e.g. combining different processes for optimal results).
With these requirements in mind, we now examine each manufacturing technique for hollow shafts and how they measure up on key factors.

Cold Drawing (Seamless Tube Drawing)
Process: Cold drawing produces seamless steel tubes by pulling a hollow billet or pre-formed tube through a series of dies at room temperature. This reduces the diameter and wall thickness to the desired size with high precision. Cold drawing is often done as a finishing step on hot-extruded or pierced tubes (e.g. DOM – Drawn Over Mandrel tubing).

Suitable Materials: Commonly low-carbon and alloy steels (e.g. 1020, 4130) are used, as they have enough ductility for cold deformation. Stainless steels and non-ferrous alloys can also be cold-drawn. The process is versatile in material, but ferrous alloy tubes for shafts are typical.
Production Volume & Cost: Cold drawing is a high-throughput process (tubes can be drawn in long lengths and cut to pieces). It is cost-effective for medium to high volumes where standard tube sizes can be mass-produced. For low volumes, manufacturers can often supply off-the-shelf drawn tube in standard dimensions, avoiding a costly custom process. The process has fast production rates and yields high output ([4 things you need to know about cold drawn seamless pipe](https://www.nan-steel.com/news/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-cold-drawn-seamless-pipe.html#:~:text=3,the yield point of steel)) ([Steel and Metal Extrusion Vs. Cold Drawing – Wasatch Steel](https://www.wasatchsteel.com/steel-and-metal-extrusion-vs-cold-drawing/#:~:text=,less than cold drawn products)). Tooling (dies and mandrels) is relatively simple, and multiple reduction stages may be needed for large size changes. Overall, drawn tubing is inexpensive per piece in quantity, though setup costs for custom sizes exist.
Dimensional Accuracy: Cold drawing imparts high dimensional accuracy and concentricity. Tolerances on OD/ID are tight, often within ±0.1 mm or better, thanks to precision dies and the steady drawing process ([4 things you need to know about cold drawn seamless pipe](https://www.nan-steel.com/news/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-cold-drawn-seamless-pipe.html#:~:text=Cold drawing is a processing,piece of steel billet is)). Wall thickness uniformity is good, and straightness is maintained over long lengths. This makes drawn tubes attractive for shafts that require minimal subsequent machining.
Mechanical Properties: Cold working the metal increases its yield and tensile strength through strain hardening ([4 things you need to know about cold drawn seamless pipe](https://www.nan-steel.com/news/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-cold-drawn-seamless-pipe.html#:~:text=needs of use conditions,the yield point of steel)). For example, drawing can raise the yield point significantly (often by 20–30% or more). This strengthens the tube, which is beneficial for load-bearing capacity. However, cold drawing also introduces residual stresses and can reduce ductility if not relieved ([4 things you need to know about cold drawn seamless pipe](https://www.nan-steel.com/news/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-cold-drawn-seamless-pipe.html#:~:text=shortcoming%3A ,localized concentrated loads is weak)). In shaft manufacturing, a stress-relief anneal may be applied after drawing (especially if heavy reductions were done) to improve toughness and dimensional stability. The grain structure is elongated in the drawing direction, which can slightly improve axial fatigue strength but may need normalization for isotropy.
Surface Finish: A major advantage of cold drawing is the smooth surface finish it produces. Drawn seamless tubes have a smooth, polished-like exterior and interior surface (especially if drawn over a mandrel that sizes the ID). Typical roughness might be on the order of a few micrometers Ra or better. Compared to hot-formed tubes, cold-drawn ones have superior finish and uniformity ([4 things you need to know about cold drawn seamless pipe](https://www.nan-steel.com/news/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-cold-drawn-seamless-pipe.html#:~:text=Cold drawing is a processing,piece of steel billet is)). This can reduce or eliminate the need for surface machining of the bore or OD if the tolerances and finish are already within specification.
Post-Processing: Shafts made from drawn tubes still require some machining – e.g. cutting to length, turning of end features, creating splines/keyways, and machining of precise bearing journals. The drawn tube provides the basic hollow profile, but secondary machining ensures critical diameters and features meet specs. Heat treatment is usually needed to reach final strength: many tubes are drawn in an annealed or normalized state for formability, then the finished shaft can be quenched and tempered or case hardened as required. (Low-carbon drawn tubes might undergo carburizing to harden the surface after machining). Welding is generally not required in this route (unless attaching additional components), since the tube is seamless and one-piece.
NEV Compatibility: Cold-drawn tube as a starting point is quite compatible with NEV shaft needs. It yields a lightweight, seamless hollow with good accuracy and material properties. Material utilization is high (little waste compared to drilling out a solid bar), aiding cost and sustainability. The absence of a longitudinal weld (unlike ERW tubing) means better fatigue performance and reliability – important for dynamic motor shafts. One drawback is that drawing by itself cannot create flanges or varying diameters; any profile changes must be machined or formed by other means. Thus, a cold-drawn tube might be combined with forging or machining for features. In summary, cold-drawn seamless tubing provides an excellent blank for hollow shafts, especially in moderate/high volumes, offering precision and property benefits at low cost ([4 things you need to know about cold drawn seamless pipe](https://www.nan-steel.com/news/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-cold-drawn-seamless-pipe.html#:~:text=Cold drawing is a processing,piece of steel billet is)) ([Steel and Metal Extrusion Vs. Cold Drawing – Wasatch Steel](https://www.wasatchsteel.com/steel-and-metal-extrusion-vs-cold-drawing/#:~:text=,achieve a perfectly round shape)).
Hot Extrusion
Process: Hot extrusion involves forcing a heated billet of metal through a die to produce a continuous profile. For hollow sections like tubes, the die is outfitted with a central mandrel or pin (often attached to the press via a stem or a “dummy block” with a mandrel) to form the inner bore ([Hot Extrusion Process and its Application for Steel – IspatGuru](https://www.ispatguru.com/hot-extrusion-process-and-its-application-for-steel/#:~:text=Direct extrusion is a process,attached to the dummy block)). The billet, at a high temperature (e.g. steel at ~1200 °C), is plastically deformed under compressive forces and extruded into a long hollow length of the desired diameter and wall thickness.

Suitable Materials: Hot extrusion is widely used for aluminum alloys (which extrude readily) and is also applied to steels, titanium, and other alloys that are difficult to form cold ([Hot Extrusion Process and its Application for Steel – IspatGuru](https://www.ispatguru.com/hot-extrusion-process-and-its-application-for-steel/#:~:text=With the development of aluminum%2C,process can compete with extrusion)) ([Hot Extrusion Process and its Application for Steel – IspatGuru](https://www.ispatguru.com/hot-extrusion-process-and-its-application-for-steel/#:~:text=than in forging and hot,second to 102 per second)). For steel hollow shafts, alloys like medium-carbon steels or stainless steels can be hot-extruded into tubes. The material should have decent hot workability. Because extrusion is under high triaxial compression, it can form materials that might crack in other processes – even high-strength or less ductile alloys can be extruded without rupture ([Hot Extrusion Process and its Application for Steel – IspatGuru](https://www.ispatguru.com/hot-extrusion-process-and-its-application-for-steel/#:~:text=The principle of extrusion is,can be extruded without problems)). This makes it feasible to extrude certain high-performance steel grades into hollow form.
Production Volume & Cost: Extrusion has a high throughput for constant cross-section parts. One heated billet can produce a length of tube that is then cut into many shafts. This makes it cost-effective for high volumes once the process is set up – the per-part cost is low. However, the initial cost for extrusion tooling (dies, mandrels) and the necessity of a powerful press can be significant. For a custom hollow profile (specific OD, ID), a manufacturer would typically require a large batch to justify a production run. In lower volumes, hot extrusion is less practical unless one can use an existing standard tube size. Compared to cold drawing, hot extrusion can produce near-net shapes faster (in one pass) and with lower tooling wear, but with slightly less precision per pass. In fact, extrusion is often followed by cold drawing to refine dimensions if ultra-precise tube is needed. Still, extrusion is generally faster and cheaper per unit than cold drawing for similar shapes ([Steel and Metal Extrusion Vs. Cold Drawing – Wasatch Steel](https://www.wasatchsteel.com/steel-and-metal-extrusion-vs-cold-drawing/#:~:text=,less than cold drawn products)) and can yield complex hollow profiles in one step.
Dimensional Accuracy: Hot extruded tubes have moderate accuracy out of the press. Thermal contraction and die deflection mean tolerances are not as tight as cold-drawn tubes. Typical as-extruded diameter tolerances might be around ±0.5% of diameter, and wall thickness variation could be a few percent. However, modern techniques (e.g. lubricated extrusion with precise mandrel centering) can achieve reasonably consistent walls. Some sources note that extrusion can actually produce accurate dimensions and smooth surfaces comparable or better than drawing for certain cases ([Steel and Metal Extrusion Vs. Cold Drawing – Wasatch Steel](https://www.wasatchsteel.com/steel-and-metal-extrusion-vs-cold-drawing/#:~:text=,achieve a perfectly round shape)), but generally a cold sizing pass (drawing or rolling) is used if high precision is needed. For NEV shafts, any critical dimensions from an extruded tube would likely be machined or the tube drawn to size. Straightness of extruded tube can also be an issue (they may bow slightly when cut), so straightening might be required.
Mechanical Properties: The hot extrusion process is performed above the recrystallization temperature, so the material typically emerges in a hot-worked, recrystallized state (grains elongated during flow but then new grains form upon cooling). The resulting grain structure is refined compared to cast and generally isotropic, though elongated along the extrusion direction. Extrusion, being a compressive process, can impart large deformations safely ([Hot Extrusion Process and its Application for Steel – IspatGuru](https://www.ispatguru.com/hot-extrusion-process-and-its-application-for-steel/#:~:text=The principle of extrusion is,can be extruded without problems)), which can break up cast structure and internal defects, improving toughness. However, because it’s hot, there is no significant work-hardening retained (the metal is softened during deformation). Thus, mechanical strength of as-extruded parts is usually lower than cold-worked ones, unless the material is precipitation-hardened after. For steel shafts, one would typically normalize or quench & temper the extruded tube to achieve desired properties. The benefit of extrusion is that it can consolidate material and avoid seams; extruded seamless tubes have continuous grain flow and no weld line, yielding good fatigue strength. If a hollow billet is used in extrusion (e.g. the Mannesmann process or similar piercing followed by extrusion), properties can be quite uniform. Overall, extruded shafts have good inherent strength (comparable to forged in some cases) but will typically need a heat treatment to reach final strength levels.
Surface Finish: Hot extruded surfaces are usually covered in a thin oxide scale and can have a slightly rough texture from die contact and any lubricant (glass) used. The finish is not as smooth as cold-drawn – one might see longitudinal die lines or minor surface oxidation. That said, extrusion can yield a fairly smooth surface compared to other hot-working (better than open-die forging, for example) and avoids the parting lines of closed-die forging. One reference indicates extruded surfaces are smoother than drawn in some cases ([Steel and Metal Extrusion Vs. Cold Drawing – Wasatch Steel](https://www.wasatchsteel.com/steel-and-metal-extrusion-vs-cold-drawing/#:~:text=,less than cold drawn products)), possibly due to the hot metal flowing and the use of lubricants leaving less scoring. Typically, an extruded tube for a shaft would be cleaned (descaled) and possibly honed or machined where a fine finish is needed (bearing seats, etc.). Interior surfaces from extrusion can be quite smooth if the mandrel and process are good – often smoother than a drilled hole, since no machining marks.
Post-Processing: After extrusion, the long hollow length is cut into individual shaft blanks. Common subsequent steps include straightening, pickling or shot blasting to remove scale, and then machining of features. Often, a cold drawing or sizing operation follows extrusion if tighter tolerances or thinner walls are needed than extrusion alone could provide. Heat treatment (normalizing or annealing) may be done to refine the microstructure before final machining, and a final hardening heat treatment (Q&T or carburize) is applied after rough machining. Virtually all extruded shafts will need machining of the ends (for splines, tapers, threads, etc.) and perhaps a skim cut on the OD for precise diameter and surface finish. Welding is usually not involved unless attaching flanges or joining an extruded section with other components.
NEV Compatibility: Hot extrusion is a viable route to produce the initial hollow preform for a motor shaft. Its main advantage is in material consolidation and one-piece construction for complex hollow shapes. It’s particularly useful if a custom alloy or shape is needed that is not readily available as a tube. For high-volume EV production, a steel supplier could hot-extrude tubes at scale, giving automakers a near-net hollow that saves machining time. The lack of longitudinal weld or seam aligns with the performance requirements (no weak weld zones). However, by itself, extrusion won’t produce the final features or the highest precision needed – it shines as a front-end process to get the hollow shape efficiently. One drawback is lower dimensional precision out of the press, requiring additional processing. Also, the capital investment is high – dedicated extrusion is justified for large volume production where per-unit cost becomes low. In summary, hot extrusion provides an efficient way to create seamless hollow shafts with good basic properties and is best combined with finishing processes (drawing, machining, heat treating) to meet NEV shaft specifications ([Steel and Metal Extrusion Vs. Cold Drawing – Wasatch Steel](https://www.wasatchsteel.com/steel-and-metal-extrusion-vs-cold-drawing/#:~:text=,achieve a perfectly round shape)).
Rotary Swaging (Radial Forging)
Process: Rotary swaging is an incremental cold forming process in which a rod or tube workpiece is inserted into a swaging machine that contains multiple hammer dies arranged radially. These dies cyclically close and open while the workpiece is rotated and fed in, progressively hammering the workpiece to reduce its diameter or form a profile. When applied to a tube or hollow, swaging can reduce the wall thickness and diameter, or forge specific shapes on the outside and inside by using a mandrel. It is sometimes called radial forging or rotary forging; essentially the material is “kneaded” by rapid hammering into a new shape.

Suitable Materials: Rotary swaging is typically done cold (room temperature) or sometimes warm. It works well on ductile steels, aluminums, and even high-strength alloys when sized appropriately. Common shaft materials like carbon steels, alloy steels (e.g. 4140), and stainless steels can be swaged, though very hard initial materials may require annealing or warm swaging. Because swaging is based on multiple small deformations, it can even handle tougher alloys (and is considered a method of severe plastic deformation for grain refinement ([A review on mechanical properties and microstructure of ultrafine ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925838821045321#:~:text=A review on mechanical properties,As an))). For NEV shafts, cold-formable steel grades are suitable; if a material is too hard, it can be softened first, swaged, then re-hardened.
Production Volume & Cost: Rotary swaging equipment is relatively flexible – the same machine can produce a variety of diameters and shapes by changing dies and mandrels. This makes it ideal for medium-volume production and even economically viable for low-volume, because tooling is not as expensive as closed-die forging. Cycle times per part are short (the process is fast, with dies striking at high frequency), and multiple machines can be run for higher volumes. Key advantages are low changeover time and high reproducibility ([Rotary swaging - Felss](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/#:~:text=Advantages of the rotary swaging,process)). For example, to produce different shaft lengths or diameters, one can adjust feed and swap dies quickly. The process is efficient in material usage (no flash or cutoff scrap) – thus material cost is minimized. At high volumes, swaging can be automated (feeding cut blanks continuously). While perhaps not as high-throughput as a single-step press forging, its versatility and minimal material waste can make per-unit costs very competitive, especially given it may eliminate some machining.
Dimensional Accuracy: Modern CNC-controlled swaging machines achieve excellent accuracy and repeatability. The process can create very precise external geometries, even complex profiles with steps or tapers, due to the small incremental forming steps ([Rotary swaging - Felss](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/#:~:text=Produce the most complex geometries,using rotary swaging)). According to manufacturer data, rotary swaging can hold tight tolerances – often on the order of hundredths of a millimeter on diameters. The concentricity is inherently good if a mandrel is used for internal support. Importantly, swaging can form both external and internal features simultaneously by using shaped dies and an internal mandrel tool ([Rotary swaging - Felss](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/#:~:text=Produce
Mechanical Properties: Rotary swaging is a cold forming process, so it significantly enhances mechanical properties through work hardening and grain refinement. The repeated hammering introduces severe plastic deformation, which can refine grains into an ultrafine structure and boost strength (this technique is even used as an SPD method in research ([[PDF] A review on mechanical properties and microstructure of ultrafine ...](https://zhaogroup.hhu.edu.cn/_upload/article/files/65/9a/e87938614ec68742121a82ee63f4/5634907e-9f1b-40da-88c6-5c85fa28c3b5.pdf#:~:text=Rotary swaging ,speed pulse))). Fatigue strength in particular can improve: tests have shown rotary swaging can increase a workpiece’s fatigue strength by up to 30% ([Rotary swaging - Felss](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/#:~:text=When forming by means of,electric vehicles%2C a longer range)). This is attributed to grain flow alignment along the part and residual compressive stresses on the surface. The process also enables weight reduction – it can hollow out a solid rod or thin a tube, allowing up to 50% weight saving versus a solid shaft of equal performance ([Rotary swaging - Felss](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/#:~:text=When
Surface Finish: The swaging dies, if polished, produce a smooth, finely-ridged surface on the part. The surface has circumferential tool marks from the die segments but these are usually shallow. Because no material is cut, the surface is work-hardened and can be quite smooth. Internal surfaces, when formed against a mandrel, also come out smooth. Often the as-swaged surface roughness is good enough that critical surfaces might only need a grinding or honing if extremely tight tolerances or mirror finish is required. The process can sometimes eliminate machining – Felss (a manufacturer) notes that parts formed by swaging often require no further machining as the final geometries are achieved in-process ([Rotary swaging - Felss](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/#:~:text=In rotary swaging%2C a basic,finished products is generally unnecessary)) ([Rotary swaging - Felss](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/#:~:text=semi,finished products is generally unnecessary)). Additionally, the lack of heat means no scaling; the surfaces are clean metal.
Post-Processing: Depending on design, a swaged hollow shaft might need minimal post-processing. If the swaging formed all needed features (steps, splines, etc.), one might only do a fine machining of end faces or drilling of cross-holes, etc. However, in many cases, final machining of high-precision fits (bearing journals, threaded ends) is performed after swaging, just to ensure perfect dimensions. Heat treatment is a consideration: some manufacturers will swage the shaft in an annealed state for ease, then perform a quench and temper for final strength. Others may swage in a cold-worked state and only do a light stress-relief temper to retain most of the work hardening while relieving stress. Either way, heat treatment is usually simpler than for a forged part, since properties are already enhanced by cold work. Welding or joining is generally not needed in the swaging route unless one plans to attach a pre-forged flange or similar (but swaging can often form features that would otherwise be welded). As an example, a steering hollow shaft was made by a combination of cold forming (swaging) plus subsequent hardening and grinding, with no welding, achieving the desired shoulder feature and strength ([Hollow shaft - Felss](https://felss.com/en/anwendung/hollow-shaft/#:~:text=For this Felss hollow shaft%2C,integration with maximum resource efficiency)). This shows swaging integrates well with standard finishing steps like induction hardening of spline areas or grinding of bearing seats.
NEV Compatibility: Rotary swaging is highly compatible with NEV motor shaft manufacturing. It addresses many requirements directly: it produces a lightweight hollow with increased strength and fatigue life (benefiting durability and allowing thinner walls for weight reduction) ([Rotary swaging - Felss](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/#:~:text=When forming by means of,electric vehicles%2C a longer range)). The precision of the process means shafts can have excellent balance and alignment, critical for high-speed motors. Material utilization is very high (virtually no scrap), aligning with cost and sustainability goals. Additionally, swaging can form complex shapes in one piece – for instance, incorporating a spline or a step without welding – thus avoiding stress risers or added mass from joints. The flexibility of the process is a boon in development and production: different motor designs can be accommodated by tooling changes rather than new cast/forged blanks. If an NEV design calls for a hollow shaft with variable diameter sections or internal features, rotary swaging can likely achieve it with clever tooling design ([Rotary swaging - Felss](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/#:~:text=Produce the most complex geometries,using rotary swaging)). Given its ability to improve fatigue strength, a swaged shaft is well-suited to handle the alternating loads of an electric motor. In conclusion, rotary swaging offers a cost-effective, precision cold-forming route that enhances mechanical properties and meets the lightweight, high-performance needs of electric drive shafts ([Rotary swaging - Felss](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/#:~:text=When
Flow Forming (Shear Forming)
Process: Flow forming is an advanced cold metal forming technique similar to spin forming, but distinguished by the deliberate thinning (“flowing”) of material to achieve the final dimensions. In flow forming, a thick-walled cylindrical preform (often a short tube or cup, which may be cast, forged, or deep-drawn) is placed on a hardened mandrel. The mandrel rotates while multiple CNC-controlled rollers press against the workpiece, moving along its length. The material is forced to plastically flow in the axial direction, reducing wall thickness and elongating the part to the desired length and profile ([ Flowforming Yields Precision, Accuracy and More | PMF Industries, Inc. ](https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#:~:text=The flowforming process begins by,any combination without material removal)) ([ Flowforming Yields Precision, Accuracy and More | PMF Industries, Inc. ](https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#:~:text=preform is being compressed it,any combination without material removal)). There are two modes: forward flow forming (rollers push material toward the headstock) and backward (reverse) flow forming (rollers push toward the tailstock), used depending on whether one end is closed or open ([Flow Forming - A Complete Overview - Advanced Structural Technologies](https://astforgetech.com/flow-forming-a-complete-overview/#:~:text=Forward flow forming is often,and elongating as it goes)) ([Flow Forming - A Complete Overview - Advanced Structural Technologies](https://astforgetech.com/flow-forming-a-complete-overview/#:~:text=Two types of flow forming,conforms to the mandrel within)). Flow forming can produce long, thin-walled, high-precision hollow parts in a single setup.

Suitable Materials: A wide range of materials can be flow formed, including steels (even high-strength grades), stainless steels, aluminum and titanium alloys, and superalloys ([ Flowforming Yields Precision, Accuracy and More | PMF Industries, Inc. ](https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#:~:text=Also%2C flowforming has the ability,austenitic%2C ferretic and pH type)). It’s commonly used on difficult-to-form materials like Inconel or high-strength stainless for aerospace, which indicates the robust capability of the process ([ Flowforming Yields Precision, Accuracy and More | PMF Industries, Inc. ](https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#:~:text=Also%2C
Production Volume & Cost: Flow forming machines are CNC controlled and can be programmed for different part geometries, which provides high flexibility. Tooling primarily consists of the mandrel (which has the inverse shape of the interior) and the roller tools (standard shapes can be used, or specific profiles if needed). This means tooling cost is lower than closed-die forging and similar to or a bit higher than swaging (mandrels may need to be custom for each part shape). For production, flow forming can be efficient: cycle times are moderate (minutes per shaft, depending on length and reductions), but one machine can often produce a variety of parts with quick changeovers. It is suitable for medium to high volume production. At very high volumes, multiple machines or a transfer line might be needed to meet takt time, but it scales reasonably. The per-part cost is lowered by the fact that near-net shape is achieved, greatly reducing machining and material waste. In terms of economies of scale, flow forming becomes cost-effective once volumes justify the machine investment; many automotive suppliers use flow forming for wheel rims and clutch hubs in high volumes, for example ([Precision & Flow Forming Techn-SoWa Group Website](https://en.sowa-tech.com/jingmikejishiyebu.html#:~:text=Flow Forming)). For low volumes (prototypes), the process is still accessible if a suitable mandrel exists or can be made – you’re paying mostly setup time. Compared to alternatives, flow forming offers significant cost savings by integrating shaping steps (eliminating welds and multi-piece assembly ([ Flowforming Yields Precision, Accuracy and More | PMF Industries, Inc. ](https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#:~:text=Flowformed products can be produced,uses less energy for manufacturing))) and reducing material usage (less scrap than boring out solid). One company noted that switching to flow forming for a hollow shaft yielded weight, strength, and cost improvements over traditional methods ([Precision & Flow Forming Techn-SoWa Group Website](https://en.sowa-tech.com/jingmikejishiyebu.html#:~:text=Flow
Dimensional Accuracy: Flow forming is renowned for its ability to produce extremely precise wall thickness and profiles. Because the rollers are CNC-controlled, the wall thickness can be varied along the length as needed (even creating thicker sections in some areas, thinner in others) with tolerance on the order of thousandths of an inch (0.025–0.1 mm) ([ Flowforming Yields Precision, Accuracy and More | PMF Industries, Inc. ](https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#::text=Modern flowforming%2C which is done,few thousandths of an inch)) ([Flow Forming - A Complete Overview - Advanced Structural Technologies](https://astforgetech.com/flow-forming-a-complete-overview/#:~:text=Flow forming provides several important,on average)). Both the inner and outer diameters end up very concentric and smooth, as the inner surface replicates the mandrel exactly and the outer is formed by uniform pressure ([Flow Forming - A Complete Overview - Advanced Structural Technologies](https://astforgetech.com/flow-forming-a-complete-overview/#:~:text=In either case%2C the workpiece’s,turned on a conventional lathe)). Typical flowformed parts have wall thickness variation under ±0.1 mm and excellent roundness. The process can achieve long parts with high L/D ratios and still hold tight tolerances where other methods would struggle ([Flow Forming - A Complete Overview - Advanced Structural Technologies](https://astforgetech.com/flow-forming-a-complete-overview/#:~:text=Flow
Mechanical Properties: Flow forming significantly increases the strength of the material via cold work. As the metal is thinned up to, say, 50–70% reduction in thickness, the grains are elongated in the axial direction and dislocation density rises, boosting tensile strength and hardness dramatically ([[PDF] FLOW FORMING: A REVIEW OF RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES ...](https://iaeme.com/MasterAdmin/Journal_uploads/IJMET/VOLUME_7_ISSUE_5/IJMET_07_05_029.pdf#:~:text=,compared with other)) ([NETFORM's Two-Piece Hollow Rotor Shaft - NETFORM](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/#:~:text=Each half shaft is manufactured,that of the base material)). For example, one source noted that a 60% thickness reduction yielded an ultimate tensile strength of 160 ksi (1100 MPa) in the steel, though elongation dropped to ~15% ([ Flowforming Yields Precision, Accuracy and More | PMF Industries, Inc. ](https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#::text=After a 60 percent reduction,original product specification may have)). In practice, flowforming often results in 2–3× increase in yield strength of the base material ([NETFORM's Two-Piece Hollow Rotor Shaft - NETFORM](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/#:~:text=Each
Surface Finish: Flow forming yields excellent surface finishes. The inner surface of the shaft is formed against a hardened, ground mandrel, so it comes out with a very fine finish – often around Ra 0.5–1.5 μm (around 20–60 μin) ([Flow Forming - A Complete Overview - Advanced Structural Technologies](https://astforgetech.com/flow-forming-a-complete-overview/#:~:text=In either case%2C the workpiece’s,turned on a conventional lathe)), which is quite smooth. It essentially replicates the mandrel’s polish (minus any minor material grain texture). The outer surface is in contact with rollers; while not mirror-smooth, it is smooth and free of tool marks like those from cutting. It’s often compared to a drawn or turned finish ([Flow Forming - A Complete Overview - Advanced Structural Technologies](https://astforgetech.com/flow-forming-a-complete-overview/#:~:text=In
Post-Processing: A flowformed hollow shaft typically requires some finishing operations, but far fewer than a comparable machined forging. Common post-processing steps include: trimming the ends (if the preform had extra material on the edges), machining any threads, grooves or holes, and possibly creating features that could not be flowformed (sharp shoulders, spline teeth, etc., which might be cut afterward unless the design avoided them). Heat treatment is often done after flow forming. For example, a flowformed steel shaft might be quench & tempered to achieve a uniform hardness and relieve forming stresses – the prior cold work will aid in getting a fine tempered martensite. Alternatively, if the as-formed strength is already sufficient, a low-temperature stress relief can be used to just reduce residual stresses without softening much. Some NEV shaft designs might combine flow forming with welding/joining: an example is Netform’s two-piece hollow rotor shaft, where two flowformed halves are laser-welded together to form a longer shaft ([NETFORM's Two-Piece Hollow Rotor Shaft - NETFORM](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/#:~:text=NETFORM has created a hollow,welded together in the center)) ([NETFORM's Two-Piece Hollow Rotor Shaft - NETFORM](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/#:~:text=Each half shaft is manufactured,that of the base material)). This approach is taken if the part is too long or complex to flowform in one piece, or to integrate an internal support structure. In that case, a high-quality weld must be done and inspected, but it allows extremely long shafts or mixed-process designs. In general, however, flow forming tries to avoid welds by making a one-piece hollow. Machining of end features (splines, flats) is usually required, as flow forming excels at smooth cylindrical shapes but cannot easily create fine axial features like splines (though internal splines or profiles can sometimes be integrated by using a splined mandrel on a short part ([Precision & Flow Forming Techn-SoWa Group Website](https://en.sowa-tech.com/jingmikejishiyebu.html#:~:text=Flow Forming)), this is less common for shafts). Finally, if tight tolerances on OD are needed, a polish or grind might be done, but often this is minimal. The result is a finished shaft with very little material removed or wasted in the entire chain.
NEV Compatibility: Flow forming is arguably one of the most suitable processes for NEV hollow motor shafts. It directly addresses weight, strength, and precision: it produces lightweight shafts with higher strength and fatigue life (due to grain flow and work hardening) and does so with excellent concentricity and balance for high-speed performance (Flow Forming - A Complete Overview - Advanced Structural Technologies). The process lends itself to integrating the shaft with other components: for instance, a flowformed rotor shaft can be made as part of an assembly with end hubs or flanges either pre-attached or post-attached. Its ability to produce long, thin-walled structures means even high-speed motors (which often need long shafts for multiple components) can have a single-piece hollow shaft without resorting to welding multiple pieces ([NETFORM's Two-Piece Hollow Rotor Shaft - NETFORM](https://netform.com/netforms-two-piece-hollow-rotor-shaft/#:~:text=NETFORM has created a hollow,welded together in the center)). In terms of efficiency and cost, flow forming offers material savings (no large bore drilling scrap) and fewer welds ([ Flowforming Yields Precision, Accuracy and More | PMF Industries, Inc. ](https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#:~:text=Flowformed products can be produced,uses less energy for manufacturing)). A case study indicated major improvements in weight, strength, and cost for a hollow EV motor shaft when switching to flow forming vs. a traditional process ([Precision & Flow Forming Techn-SoWa Group Website](https://en.sowa-tech.com/jingmikejishiyebu.html#:~:text=Flow Forming type ,improved than the traditional process)). One must ensure the final properties meet requirements – typically by adding a controlled heat treatment step. When properly implemented, flow forming can produce a near-net shape hollow shaft with minimal subsequent processing and superior performance, making it highly attractive for the EV industry’s push for efficiency and reliability ([Precision & Flow Forming Techn-SoWa Group Website](https://en.sowa-tech.com/jingmikejishiyebu.html#:~:text=Flow
Hydroforming
Process: Hydroforming is a forming process where a tube or hollow workpiece is placed inside a die cavity and then pressurized internally by fluid (typically water or oil at very high pressure) to expand the material outward into the die shape ([Hydroforming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroforming#:~:text=Hydroforming is a specialized type,To hydroform)). For a hollow shaft, tube hydroforming would involve using a slightly smaller diameter tube blank, sealing it at the ends, and using fluid pressure (and sometimes axial compression) to cause the tube to bulge or expand where the die has larger cavities (or to conform to a different cross-section). Hydroforming can create stepped or variable diameter hollow shafts and incorporate features like flanges, protrusions, or yokes in one piece that would otherwise require welding pieces together.

Suitable Materials: Materials must have good ductility to deform plastically under tension during expansion. Common choices are low-carbon steels, HSLA steels, stainless steel, and aluminum for automotive hydroforming. Many EV motor shafts use case-hardening steels (which in annealed condition are quite formable) – these could be hydroformed then later hardened. The material needs to tolerate the biaxial stretch; for example, a steel tube might be hydroformed to 10–30% expansion of diameter without necking if properly controlled. If high-strength steel is used, careful control or pre-heating (warm hydroforming) might be needed to get enough formability. In practice, mild steel or annealed alloy steel tubes would be ideal blanks for hydroforming a shaft.
Production Volume & Cost: Hydroforming became popular in automotive manufacturing for high-volume production of complex structural components (like engine cradles, frame rails) because it can replace multiple stampings and weldments with one piece. The cost per part becomes low at scale, but the initial investment in hydroforming equipment and the matched die sets is significant. For a hollow shaft, the dies would be relatively simple (likely split dies to allow insertion of a straight tube and then formation of a bulge or step). The cycle time for tube hydroforming can be relatively fast (seconds to a minute per part, depending on pressure hold times), and it can be highly automated. Thus for mass production of a particular shaft shape, hydroforming is viable and can be very economical (especially if it eliminates welding operations). For lower volumes or many variant shapes, it is less flexible than CNC-based processes – each distinct shape requires a custom die set. However, one advantage is that hydroforming can often utilize standard tubing as a starting blank (e.g. a standard drawn tube), so you don’t need custom forging blanks. Cost-effectiveness is best when the shaft design includes features that would otherwise need additional parts; hydroforming shines when it consolidates multiple operations. If just making a simple straight tube, hydroforming is unnecessary overhead – it’s only worth it if you’re forming shape features. Overall, hydroforming is a medium to high volume process with cost benefits realized in high throughput production (like thousands to millions of parts), such as in the automotive industry ([Hydroforming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroforming#:~:text=,101] and radiator supports)) ([Hydroforming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroforming#:~:text=support
Dimensional Accuracy: Hydroforming can achieve good dimensional accuracy, though typically not as fine as machining or flow forming. The process uses rigid dies, so the final shape is constrained by the die cavity. Critical dimensions can be held to around ±0.3–0.8 mm in many cases ([Hydroforming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroforming#:~:text=Hydroforming is capable of producing,female die together are eliminated)). Aircraft applications of hydroformed sheet metal claim tolerances around 0.76 mm ([Hydroforming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroforming#:~:text=Hydroforming
Mechanical Properties: Hydroforming is mostly a shape-forming process and does not inherently improve material properties like forging or cold working would. In fact, the material in the expanded areas undergoes tensile thinning, which will cause some work hardening (raising yield strength a bit) but at the expense of thickness. The strength in the bulged areas may increase slightly due to cold work, but ductility will decrease there. If the expansion is moderate, the effect on mechanical properties is not drastic – the part remains close to the parent tube’s properties. If one hydroforms in an annealed state, a subsequent heat treat (e.g. carburizing or Q&T) would typically set the final properties, essentially overriding the forming effects. The grain structure isn’t deliberately refined as in forging – though it will follow the new shape. One benefit is that no welding is involved, so the part’s strength is continuous and not limited by a weld joint (the technique historically reduced the need for welded tube assemblies ([Hydroforming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroforming#:~:text=hydraulic pressure vs,12)) ([Hydroforming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroforming#:~:text=options as well%2C reducing the,12))). If the design requires consistent wall thickness, hydroforming can be controlled to minimize thinning (sometimes axial feeding of the tube ends is used to push material into the expansion). In terms of fatigue, hydroformed parts can perform well if the surface is smooth and no major thickness reductions cause local stress raisers. The corners or transitions might see some thinning, which could be fatigue hot-spots if not accounted for. In general, hydroformed shafts will have material properties comparable to the starting tube, possibly with slight strengthening in expanded zones. Post-process heat treatment can be applied to regain toughness if needed. For instance, if a carburizing steel is hydroformed into a shaft, it can then be carburized and hardened, resulting in a high-strength hardened shaft with a complex shape. There is little grain flow optimization here as there would be in forging – hydroforming is more about geometry.
Surface Finish: The process tends to produce a smooth outer surface because the tube expands to press against the polished die walls. Unlike traditional stamping, there isn’t a sliding action of metal between two die halves (the fluid pressure pushes it outwards), so draw marks or scratches are largely eliminated ([Hydroforming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroforming#:~:text=Hydroforming is capable of producing,female die together are eliminated)). The result is often a smoother finish than comparable stamped/welded parts. The inner surface of the tube remains essentially as it was (since it’s just pressurized fluid touching it). If a smooth drawn tube was used, the ID stays smooth; if a rougher seam tube was used, the seam is still there internally. So using a seamless drawn tube as input would yield a smooth ID and OD after forming. Hydroforming can sometimes leave slight marks at the die partition lines or at spots where material locks in, but these are usually minor. Because the process is at room temperature (usually), no scaling occurs, and the surfaces retain their metallic luster or coating (in fact, pre-lubrication is needed, which is then cleaned off). If needed, the part can be given a surface treatment post forming (like shot peening to improve fatigue, or plating for corrosion). Often though, hydroformed parts are used as-formed on the surfaces that matter. So overall, surface quality is high – one advantage noted is the elimination of many fitting or welding inaccuracies, giving a contiguous smooth surface. Any cosmetic or very precision surface might be machined or ground, but the bulk of the shaft can remain as hydroformed with acceptable finish.
Post-Processing: After hydroforming a shaft, typical next steps would include trimming the ends (if the tube ends were sealed by welded caps or plugs, those sections get cut off) and machining any interface features. For example, if one end of the hollow shaft needs a spline or a flange, that might be welded on or machined from an intentionally thicker section of the tube. It’s not uncommon to combine hydroforming with welding: one might hydroform a tube to shape and then weld on forged end pieces (like stub shafts with splines or threaded ends). This way, each process does what it’s best at – hydroforming makes the lightweight, complex middle section, and forging provides robust ends, with welding to join. If the hydroformed shape itself includes things like a flange or yoke, holes might be pierced (some hydroforming setups can also punch holes using the pressure or auxiliary punches when the part is pressurized). Heat treatment would follow if required; for an NEV shaft material, likely a quench & temper or case hardening would be done to achieve final strength. Hydroformed parts may require leak testing if they function as a pressure conduit, but for a motor shaft that’s solid (just hollow inside) that’s not a concern except if it’s part of an oil flow path (in which case ensuring no pinhole bursts occurred is important). By and large, the amount of machining is far less than if starting from solid or assembling pieces – hydroforming might have created near-net shapes for features. Assembly-wise, hydroforming can eliminate some welding operations: the shaft is one piece. But if welded end pieces are used, those welds must be high quality (often inertia welding or laser welding could be employed). The formed part might also undergo a calibration step (placing it in a sizing die and repressurizing lightly or mechanically expanding slightly) to fine-tune critical dimensions if needed.
NEV Compatibility: Hydroforming is particularly useful if the motor shaft design is geometrically complex, e.g., if it requires an integrated step-change in diameter, or attached coolant passages, or other shapes that would otherwise need multiple components. An example could be a shaft with an enlarged mid-section for a rotor hub or one end flared to mount a pulley – hydroforming could make that in one piece. By avoiding welding those features on, you save weight and remove potential failure points. Hydroformed hollow shafts have been investigated (e.g. stepped hollow shafts via hydroforming double-layer tubes ([Effect of loading paths on hydroforming ability of stepped hollow ...](https://journal.eu-jr.eu/engineering/article/view/2797#:~:text=Effect of loading paths on,Vu Hanoi University of))) showing it’s feasible to form multi-material or multi-layer shafts for added functionality. The performance of a hydroformed shaft can meet NEV needs: it’s still essentially a seamless tube (no longitudinal seam), so rotational balance and fatigue can be good. The process can concentrate material where needed (thicker corners or fillets as per die design) and thin it where not needed, optimizing weight. For high-volume NEV production, hydroforming could churn out identical shafts with minimal variation, fitting the reliability requirements. That said, hydroforming is not as commonly applied to motor shafts as some other methods, likely because a typical motor shaft is mostly straight with maybe minor features. If the shaft is essentially a straight cylinder, using hydroforming adds little value over starting with a tube and machining. But for integrated cooling channels or flanges on shafts, hydroforming could be a key enabler (for instance, expanding a portion of the shaft to create an internal coolant reservoir or to press-fit laminations). It aligns well with performance and efficiency requirements when those require complex geometry. One must ensure that the thinning in hydroforming doesn’t compromise strength where it matters. Usually, with proper design (and possibly simulation to avoid fracture), a hydroformed shaft can meet strength targets and then be heat-treated to required hardness. In summary, tube hydroforming is a specialized but powerful option for hollow shafts that allows one-piece construction of shapes impractical by other means, delivering smooth surfaces and decent tolerances ([Hydroforming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroforming#:~:text=Hydroforming is capable of producing,female die together are eliminated)) ([Hydroforming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroforming#:~:text=,101] and radiator supports)). Its usage in NEV motors will depend on the specific shaft design complexity and volume demands.
Metal Injection Molding (MIM)
Process: Metal Injection Molding is a near-net shape process where metal powder is mixed with a binder to create a feedstock that can be injected into a mold (much like plastic injection molding). After molding the “green” part, the binder is removed and the part is sintered at high temperature to densify the powder into a solid metal piece. MIM is well-suited for small-to-medium sized, complex-shaped parts that would be costly to machine. A hollow motor shaft (particularly if it has complex geometry like internal features or external splines) could in principle be made by MIM in one piece, including its hollow center.

Suitable Materials: A wide variety of alloys are available in MIM, including low-alloy steels (e.g. 4140, 4605, 17Ni steels), stainless steels (304L, 316L, 17-4 PH), tool steels, even titanium and superalloys ([Metal Injection Molding | Materials and Properties](https://www.newayprecision.com/blogs/metal-injection-molding-materials-and-properties#:~:text=Stainless Steel)) ([Metal Injection Molding | Materials and Properties](https://www.newayprecision.com/blogs/metal-injection-molding-materials-and-properties#:~:text=Properties And Applications)). For an NEV shaft, one might choose a low-alloy steel that can be carburized or through-hardened (4600 series steel is common in MIM and can be heat treated to good strength ([The Future of Automotive Manufacturing- Metal Injection Molding](https://www.indo-mim.com/metal-injection-molding-automotive/#:~:text=Selection of the proper material,for applications with their properties)) (The Future of Automotive Manufacturing- Metal Injection Molding)). The key is that the material can be sintered to high density and meet mechanical needs. MIM can achieve final densities of 96–99% of wrought material. Magnetic alloys are also possible ([Metal Injection Molding | Materials and Properties](https://www.newayprecision.com/blogs/metal-injection-molding-materials-and-properties#::text=Magnetic Alloy)) ([Metal Injection Molding | Materials and Properties](https://www.newayprecision.com/blogs/metal-injection-molding-materials-and-properties#:~:text=Magnetic
Production Volume & Cost: MIM has high fixed costs (tooling for molds, development of the feedstock and sintering cycle) but low marginal costs per part at high volume. It is typically recommended for medium to high volume production – often on the order of thousands to millions of parts – to amortize the mold costs. If an NEV motor platform needed tens of thousands of identical shafts, MIM could be considered, especially if the shaft geometry is complex (justifying MIM’s strength in producing intricate shapes with little labor). MIM can produce multiple parts per injection if the parts are small by using multi-cavity molds. However, a motor shaft might be fairly large (e.g. 20 cm length), which pushes the size limit of MIM. Larger MIM parts are possible but require big presses and more expensive debinding/sintering with risk of distortion. Typically, MIM shines for parts below 100 grams. A hollow shaft could be light if thin-walled, but its length might be limiting – one might mold it in sections or use multiple gates. Cost-effectiveness for a shaft would need analyzing: if the shaft has features (gear teeth, spline, holes) that would otherwise need many machining steps, MIM might consolidate them and save cost. On the other hand, simpler shafts are cheaper to produce by machining a tube. So MIM’s value is highest for complex, net-shape parts. If it is used, the per-part cost at high volume can be quite low (on par with powdered metallurgy pressed parts or castings), and you avoid much post-processing. For lower volumes or prototyping, MIM is generally not economical due to tooling, though recent advancements in 3D binder jet printing could produce similar results without molds (beyond our scope). Summing up, MIM is a high-volume, high-complexity suitable process, but one would not use it for a straightforward shaft in low quantity. The automotive industry does use MIM for certain high-precision components like gearboxes, turbocharger parts, lock mechanisms, etc., showing it can meet automotive cost and scale needs ([Metal Injection Molding in the automotive industry - PIM International](https://www.pim-international.com/metal-injection-molding/applications-for-mim-ii-the-automotive-industry/#::text=International www.pim,steering systems and electronic systems)) ([Metal Injection Molding | Materials and Properties - Neway Precision](https://www.newayprecision.com/blogs/metal-injection-molding-materials-and-properties#:~:text=Precision www,MIM parts in the)).
Dimensional Accuracy: MIM parts are known for having excellent as-molded detail and good dimensional accuracy, typically ±0.3%–0.5% of dimensions. For a 100 mm length shaft, this might be ±0.3 mm. Often, close tolerances around ±0.1 mm can be achieved on smaller features, and fine details like splines or threads can be molded in directly (or via secondary molding steps for even finer detail). There is shrinkage during sintering (often ~15-20%), which is predictable and uniform if the process is controlled, but slight variations in shrinkage can introduce variability. Consistency can be high for large production once the process is tuned. If extremely tight tolerances are needed on certain surfaces (say a bearing journal), the common practice is to mold the part slightly oversized there and then perform a finish grinding or machining after sintering (the material is like conventional metal after sintering, so it can be machined or ground). For a hollow shaft, maintaining straightness might be a challenge; sintering could cause slight warpage. However, techniques like sintering with supports or in a fixture can help maintain straightness. Some MIM parts are “sized” after sintering – essentially a calibration pressing to bring them into exact shape. Surface detail resolution is very good (features like small holes or splines can be formed to near-net shape). In short, MIM can deliver a near-final shape that only needs minimal machining on critical surfaces. For instance, an external spline could be molded to final dimensions (no cutting needed), and an internal bore can be molded into the part so no drilling is needed. The overall accuracy is sufficient that many MIM automotive parts (like certain shafts or gears) are used without further machining, especially if they are not extremely long.
Mechanical Properties: Modern MIM parts can reach 95-100% of the strength of wrought materials, provided they are nearly fully dense and properly heat treated ([Metal Injection Molding | Materials and Properties](https://www.newayprecision.com/blogs/metal-injection-molding-materials-and-properties#::text=Applications%3A Low alloy steels find,undergo heavy loads and wear)) ([The Future of Automotive Manufacturing- Metal Injection Molding](https://www.indo-mim.com/metal-injection-molding-automotive/#:~:text=Metal Injection Molding technology has,to machine%2C can be processed)). Low-alloy steel MIM parts, once sintered and heat-treated, have been used in demanding applications like engine timing system components, transmission gears, and turbocharger vanes ([Metal Injection Molding in the automotive industry - PIM International](https://www.pim-international.com/metal-injection-molding/applications-for-mim-ii-the-automotive-industry/#:~:text=International www.pim,steering systems and electronic systems)). A MIM 4140 or 4605 steel shaft, for example, can be carburized to get a hardened case and a tough core, much like a forged part. The presence of a small fraction of porosity (if any remains, say 1-3%) can slightly reduce properties: tensile strength might be 5-10% lower than a fully dense counterpart, and fatigue endurance limit can be more affected (pores can initiate cracks). However, this can be mitigated by achieving high density and perhaps shot peening to improve fatigue. Material properties can be high: e.g., MIM low-alloy steels can reach 1200+ MPa tensile after heat treat, and 1–2% elongation if heavily hardened or more if tempered lower. One must ensure the sintering is done well to avoid large pore clusters. In critical cases, Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) can post-densify MIM parts to eliminate nearly all porosity (rarely done due to cost, but possible). MIM also allows alloy tailoring – one could use a high-performance alloy not feasible in casting or machining easily. For example, a MIM Co-Ni steel could give ultra high strength. For NEV shafts, the key mechanical requirement is usually torsional strength and fatigue. MIM has been used to produce gears, sprockets, and shafts that require high strength and durability in automotive applications ([Metal Injection Molding | Materials and Properties](https://www.newayprecision.com/blogs/metal-injection-molding-materials-and-properties#:~:text=Applications%3A
Surface Finish: The as-sintered surface of MIM parts is generally smooth but matte. Since it replicates the mold cavity surface, initially the “green” part might have a relatively smooth surface from the mold (which can be polished). After sintering, there is uniform shrinkage, and the surface can get slightly rougher as the particles sinter together (there’s a certain graininess at the microscopic level). Typical surface roughness might be around Ra 3–6 μm for as-sintered MIM surfaces. This is better than as-cast surfaces, but not as smooth as a machined or drawn surface. If needed, surfaces can be tumbled, blasted, or polished to improve finish. For functional surfaces like bearing fits, a light grind would achieve the needed smoothness. However, MIM can form fine details like small fillets and radii that improve the functional surface (no abrupt edges). Also, because of being near-net, no heavy machining marks are present; any roughness is more like a fine texture. MIM shafts would likely have a good finish on the OD, and the ID (if molded via a core pin) would also be formed rather than drilled, possibly requiring reaming if a very smooth bore is needed. In context, the surface finish is adequate for many uses, and secondary finishing can be limited to specific areas. The advantage is that MIM avoids long machining passes that could introduce micro-tears or directional marks; its surfaces are isotropic from sintering. So, surface quality is decent out-of-furnace, and critical surfaces can be selectively improved by minor machining or polishing.
Post-Processing: A MIM-produced hollow shaft would emerge from sintering slightly undersized (because parts are often designed to shrink to final size). Typical post processes: heat treatment (as discussed, to harden/strengthen), surface treatment (like carburizing or nitriding if needed for wear), and finish machining of certain features. For example, one might drill a precise cross-hole or tap a thread that is hard to mold, or face the ends for perpendicularity. Often, sizing (coining) is done immediately after sintering while the part is still warm and malleable: the part is pressed in a die to exact dimensions, improving tolerances and sometimes surface finish. For a shaft, this could straighten it and perfect the roundness. Any required joining or assembly could be done now – but ideally, the shaft is one integral piece, so no welding needed. If the design intended to incorporate other pieces (like a magnet holder or balancing weight), they might be assembled via press-fit. Machining operations like grinding bearing journals or broaching keyways are feasible on sintered material. But MIM tries to minimize these to justify itself. After heat treat, hard machining (grinding) or hard turning with CBN may be done on surfaces that have tight tolerances or high hardness. Another consideration: MIM parts usually require debinding and sintering cycles that can be lengthy (many hours in furnace), but these are batch processes that run in parallel to injection, so they don’t impact per-part labor. For QA, MIM parts might get X-ray or ultrasonic inspection if looking for internal voids on critical parts, but a well-sintered part shouldn’t have internal defects beyond slight porosity.
NEV Compatibility: MIM offers a unique proposition for NEV motor shafts if the design is highly complex or miniaturized. For instance, if an electric motor had a small hollow shaft with internal cooling channels or integrated gear teeth, MIM could potentially form those in one piece, which would be extremely hard to achieve by machining or forging. The design flexibility is a big plus ([The Future of Automotive Manufacturing- Metal Injection Molding](https://www.indo-mim.com/metal-injection-molding-automotive/#:~:text=Metal Injection Molding technology has,temperature steels and)) – engineers could design shapes without regard to cutting tool access, and MIM could realize them. In terms of performance, a MIM shaft can be made to meet high strength and durability requirements ([Metal Injection Molding | Materials and Properties](https://www.newayprecision.com/blogs/metal-injection-molding-materials-and-properties#:~:text=Applications%3A Low alloy steels find,undergo heavy loads and wear)), as evidenced by MIM usage in engines and transmissions. For NEVs, where efficiency is key, a MIM shaft might allow slight design tweaks (like lattice structures or ribbing) inside the shaft to reduce weight or manage vibrations, which no other process could create easily. On the flip side, making a relatively large, straight, simple shaft via MIM is likely unnecessary – more straightforward methods would suffice. MIM shines if it replaces multi-piece assemblies with one net-shape part ([The Future of Automotive Manufacturing- Metal Injection Molding](https://www.indo-mim.com/metal-injection-molding-automotive/#:~:text=Figure 1,resulting in significant cost savings)), yielding cost and weight savings. If an NEV motor shaft can incorporate multiple functions (coolant conduit, rotor mounting features, etc.) in one MIM part, that could be beneficial. The process meets efficiency requirements in the sense that it can produce near-net shape with little scrap (unused powder can be recycled), and material usage is high. Also, because MIM can use low-alloy steel and then heat treat, you can have a tough core and hard surface, exactly what shafts often need. One must consider quality consistency – with proper control, MIM parts are very consistent, but it requires a mature process (automotive MIM suppliers have achieved this for many components). In conclusion, MIM is suitable for NEV hollow shafts primarily if the design is complex and high-volume, offering an integration of features and a balance of good properties, but it’s not typically the first choice for a basic shaft due to cost and size limitations.
Forging (Open-Die, Closed-Die, Precision Forging)
Process: Forging encompasses several techniques of shaping metal through plastic deformation under compressive forces. For hollow shafts, forging can be applied in different ways:

Open-Die Forging: A hot billet is shaped between flat or simple tools (anvils) to draw it out and maybe pierced to create a hollow. This is often used for large shafts (e.g. wind turbine shafts) by forging a solid ingot, then drilling a hole.
Closed-Die (Impression) Forging: The heated billet is pressed between shaped dies that constrain the metal flow to fill a cavity, producing near-net shapes. A hollow can be forged by including a punch or mandrel in the die (or by forging a donut shape and then punching through).
Precision Forging: A form of closed-die forging with very tight control and near-net finishing, possibly requiring little machining. Precision forging can create detailed features like splines or gear teeth on a part in the forging step itself, reducing machining.
Radial/Axial Forging: Methods like rotary forging (similar to swaging but hot) or cross-wedge rolling (rolling and pressing a round bar to create a hollow shaft shape) also fall under forging processes for shafts.
Forging generally will be done hot (for steel typically ~1200 °C) for significant shape changes, although cold forging of hollow shafts is possible in some precision cases (e.g. cold forging a tubular part with internal mandrel).

Suitable Materials: Most forging of shafts uses steel (carbon or alloy) because of steel’s forgeability and resulting high strength. Common NEV shaft materials like 20MnCr5 (a case-hardening steel) forge well when hot and can later be heat-treated. Other materials such as aluminum or titanium can also be forged into hollow shapes (Al is easier, Ti requires careful control). Generally, forging works for any forgeable alloy: medium-carbon steels, alloy steels (e.g. 4140, 4340), stainless steels (with care for hot working temp), etc. For high-performance, one might choose a Cr-Mo or Ni-Cr-Mo steel that, after forging and heat treat, has excellent fatigue strength. Open-die forging is often used for very large shafts from steel ingots, whereas closed-die forging can be used for smaller shafts to near net shape.
Production Volume & Cost: Forging can be efficient at high volumes if using multi-cavity closed-die setups and automated presses – each press stroke yields a part (plus some flash). The cost per part then becomes low after paying off the die tooling. However, die costs for closed-die forging are significant, and each part design needs its own dies. Thus, forging is common for automotive drivetrain parts produced in large numbers (e.g. transmission shafts), but less so for low-volume bespoke parts. Open-die forging is more flexible and used for low-volume large parts (with high per-unit cost but no expensive specialized dies – the trade-off is more machining later). For NEV motor shafts, which might number in the hundreds of thousands for a popular model, closed-die or precision forging is economically viable. It can produce a near-net shape that requires minimal machining, saving on material and machining costs. For moderate volumes, forging from a standard tubular blank (rather than solid bar) can reduce costs by cutting material waste and forging energy. In fact, a modern approach is to use a seamless steel tube as starting stock in forging, which dramatically improves material yield (from 30% to ~68%) and halves processing steps compared to forging from solid bar ([NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD - European Patent Office - EP 3854517 A1](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/45/d9/d8/6a600c526a36d3/EP3854517A1.pdf#::text=,steps and phosphorous saponification treatments)) ([NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD - European Patent Office - EP 3854517 A1](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/45/d9/d8/6a600c526a36d3/EP3854517A1.pdf#:~:text=
Dimensional Accuracy: Forging yields parts that are near-net but usually require some machining for final dimensions. Closed-die forgings can be quite close – perhaps ±0.3 to 0.5 mm on certain dimensions for a well-made precision forging. They will have parting line flash to trim and slight draft angles on vertical walls. However, forging ensures material is where it needs to be, with generous fillets and smooth flow, which is good for performance. In precision forging (like net shape gear forging), features can be within minimal stock allowance for grinding (for example, forged splines might only need shaving or none at all if accurate enough). The concentricity and straightness of forged hollow shafts depend on the process: using a mandrel during forging can maintain concentricity of the bore. Processes like three-roll skew rolling or cross-wedge rolling can produce remarkably concentric hollow shafts with constant wall thickness ([The Mechanism of Forming Hollow Shafts with Constant Wall ... - MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/14/6/702#:~:text=The Mechanism of Forming Hollow,is good%2C but its)). For instance, skew rolling a hollow tube can achieve uniform walls and good straightness due to the continuous nature of the process. On the other hand, open-die forging a solid and then drilling yields accuracy mostly from the drilling operation (which can be quite precise but may wander slightly over length). So, forging plus machining can certainly meet tight tolerances, but forging alone (without any machining) is typically not to final dimension quality. One notable method is forging the hollow shaft in multiple stages with dies, including using a mandrel to forge internal spline shapes in the third stage, as described in a patent process ([NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD - European Patent Office - EP 3854517 A1](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/45/d9/d8/6a600c526a36d3/EP3854517A1.pdf#:~:text=in step 4 comprises three,of the second forging pass)) ([NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD - European Patent Office - EP 3854517 A1](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/45/d9/d8/6a600c526a36d3/EP3854517A1.pdf#:~:text=into
Mechanical Properties: Forging is traditionally chosen for the best mechanical properties. The deformation and thermal cycle of forging break up cast structure, close internal voids, and result in refined grain flow following the shape. A properly forged shaft will have grain lines running along the length and around any flanges, which enhances strength and fatigue resistance in those directions. This is why drivetrain shafts are often forged – the grain flow around splines and shoulders improves their fatigue life. The slow cooling after hot forging acts like a normalizing treatment, producing a uniform fine-pearlitic microstructure (for steel) that can then be heat-treated. The strength of a forged part after final quench & temper is typically as high as or higher than any other manufacturing route for the same alloy. Also, the absence of welds or joins in a one-piece forging means the shaft is monolithic and robust. If forging from solid bar, the downside is material waste and fiber continuity only in certain directions. If forging from a tube, one retains the hollow shape benefits while still getting forging’s microstructural benefits – significantly improved material yield and reduced steps were reported using a hollow cold-rolled seamless steel pipe as forging stock ([NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD - European Patent Office - EP 3854517 A1](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/45/d9/d8/6a600c526a36d3/EP3854517A1.pdf#:~:text=of hollow shafts%2C a bar,steps and phosphorous saponification treatments)) (NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD - European Patent Office - EP 3854517 A1). This method saved multiple forging and heat treat steps and achieved 68% material utilization vs ~30% from solid ([NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD - European Patent Office - EP 3854517 A1](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/45/d9/d8/6a600c526a36d3/EP3854517A1.pdf#::text=
Surface Finish: As-forged surfaces are relatively rough. Closed-die forgings have a roughness from the die (dies are not highly polished usually) and oxidation from hot metal; plus they have parting line flashes. Open-die forgings are rougher, often with scale pits. Thus, shafts are almost always machined on the outside and inside to some degree. However, forging can reduce how much machining is needed by being near shape. For example, if a spline is forged, its sides might still be rough but very close to final dimension, requiring a shaving or broach to get smooth flanks. If not precision forged, assume all functional surfaces will be machined or ground after forging. The interior of a hollow forging (if one exists) might be shaped by a tool, but likely still needs boring or honing for a smooth finish. So the forging’s contribution is not surface finish, but rather shape and structure. Precision forging could produce a somewhat smoother surface if using highly finished dies and possibly lower temperatures (or flashless forging). Still, forging is not chosen for surface finish – it’s understood that subsequent machining or surface grinding will produce the final smooth surfaces needed on a motor shaft. Post-forging processes like shot blasting can clean the surface to a uniform matte finish for handling before machining. In summary, expect forged shafts to need finishing cuts for a good surface finish.
Post-Processing: A forged hollow shaft undergoes several post-forge steps. Trimming of flash (in closed-die forging) is immediate. Then usually a normalizing or annealing heat treatment is done to soften the structure for machining and relieve forging stresses. Next comes machining: deep hole drilling or boring (if the hollow wasn’t fully formed during forging), turning the OD to size, creating threads or grooves, and milling or broaching splines if not forged in. Some advanced processes as cited combine forging and minimal machining by using hollow preforms and multi-stage dies to form features ([NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD - European Patent Office - EP 3854517 A1](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/45/d9/d8/6a600c526a36d3/EP3854517A1.pdf#:~:text=in step 4 comprises three,of the second forging pass)) ([NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD - European Patent Office - EP 3854517 A1](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/45/d9/d8/6a600c526a36d3/EP3854517A1.pdf#:~:text=into
NEV Compatibility: Forging (especially with modern techniques) provides superior mechanical integrity, which is great for high-performance EV motors that output large torque pulses. A forged shaft will handle shock loads and high speeds confidently. For example, one could design a hollow shaft forging such that fiber flow goes around the spline teeth and down the length, giving maximum strength where needed. The main drawback of forging is possibly cost and material waste for lower volumes. But innovations like using a hollow starting billet for forging have significantly improved material efficiency and reduced cost/time by 50% ([NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD - European Patent Office - EP 3854517 A1](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/45/d9/d8/6a600c526a36d3/EP3854517A1.pdf#::text=of hollow shafts%2C a bar,steps and phosphorous saponification treatments)) (NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD - European Patent Office - EP 3854517 A1), making forging more attractive for hollow shafts. With that approach, forging aligns well with the goal of minimizing wasted metal (which is also an environmental and cost benefit). Another benefit is that forging processes are well-established in automotive supply chains, meaning quality control and consistency can be very high (important for NEV manufacturers wanting reliability). A well-forged and heat-treated shaft should meet or exceed all NEV requirements for strength, fatigue, and precision (after finish machining). Many existing automotive shafts (in transmissions, axles, etc.) are forged, so the process scales to millions of parts reliably. NEV motor shafts could similarly be forged if the design suits it (some are already doing so). For instance, if an EV motor shaft needs an integral gear at one end, forging is a great way to form the gear and shaft together, then just machine the teeth to spec – better than cutting a gear and then joining to a shaft. Considering efficiency: a lighter hollow forging vs a solid can reduce inertia, and forging’s grain alignment can allow a thinner wall for same strength, so performance per weight is optimized. In conclusion, forging (especially precision forging + tubular preforms) is a top contender for manufacturing hollow EV motor shafts, offering a balance of quality and potentially low unit cost at scale, with the only downsides being the upfront tooling and the need for finish machining and perhaps joining if combining with other elements ([NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD - European Patent Office - EP 3854517 A1](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/45/d9/d8/6a600c526a36d3/EP3854517A1.pdf#:~:text=
Spin Forming (Conventional Metal Spinning)
Process: Metal spinning (or spin forming) is a traditional process where a disc or tube of metal is rotated on a lathe-like machine, and a tool (roller or stylus) is pressed against it to gradually shape it over a mandrel. Unlike flow forming, conventional spinning usually starts with a flat blank or a preform and mainly shapes it without intentionally thinning the material significantly (except in a variant called shear spinning). For a hollow shaft, spin forming could mean starting with a short tube or cup and flaring or reducing sections, or creating a hollow shape from a flat disc by spinning it into a cup. The process is often done by hand or CNC, with one roller tool pushing the material to conform to the mandrel shape.

Suitable Materials: Similar to flow forming, materials must be ductile enough to sustain spinning deformation. Aluminum, copper, and mild steel are very common in spinning due to their excellent ductility. Steel alloys can also be spun, though often some heat is applied (spinning can be done hot for hard materials). For a motor shaft, likely steel would be used; it can be spun if annealed or done in steps. Spinning is quite material-efficient (no scrap except maybe trim). If a shaft were to be spin formed, an annealed low-alloy steel could be used and then later heat-treated. The size of the part is limited by the spinning machine and the need to form without buckling – many wheel rims (large diameter but relatively short length) are flow-formed/spun, indicating up to 20" or more diameters are possible, and lengths maybe up to a few times that. A slender shaft might not be easy to form by spinning from a disc – it might instead require starting from a tube. So if spin forming is considered, a welded tube or seamless tube blank might be spun to modify its shape. That said, spin forming is more typically used for shapes like cones, domes, or short cylinders rather than long shafts.
Production Volume & Cost: Conventional spinning can be done with relatively cheap tooling (just a mandrel and maybe a follower block) compared to forging dies. It’s often used for low to medium volumes or prototyping because you can form parts without a dedicated die for each shape (one mandrel can be used to spin many parts). CNC spinning machines allow moderate automation, but the cycle time is usually longer than a press operation. For example, spinning a part might take several minutes of roller passes. Thus, for very high volumes, spinning is less productive than something like forging or extrusion. However, it’s ideal for custom or small-batch production, and medium volumes can be attained with multiple machines or multi-spindle spinners. The cost per part for spinning is mostly in labor/machine time; tooling is low. If a manufacturer wanted to experiment with a new hollow shaft geometry (like a slight bell shape on one end), they could spin-form a few prototypes inexpensively. For actual mass production in NEVs, spinning might not be fast enough if each shaft takes significant time – though if the shaft doesn’t need heavy forming (only slight shaping), spinning could be quick. In terms of economy, it competes well up to a certain volume where the break-even with stamping/forging tooling cost occurs. If the shaft geometry is simple, the break-even is low (forging would be better). If geometry is complex but low volume, spinning might be the choice. Summarily, spin forming is cost-effective for flexible, low-capital manufacture, but not usually chosen for high-volume identical parts due to cycle time.
Dimensional Accuracy: Traditional spinning, especially manual, relies on the operator’s skill or CNC path control to achieve the shape, so part-to-part variation can be larger than in a die-based process. Also, because spinning doesn’t strongly constrain the material (except against the mandrel), thickness can vary unintentionally and the final shape might spring back slightly. It’s noted that metal spinning often results in wall thickness and profiles that are not as predictable or repeatable compared to flow forming ([ Flowforming Yields Precision, Accuracy and More | PMF Industries, Inc. ](https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#:~:text=The difference between flowforming and,are neither predictable nor repeatable)). So tolerances might be on the order of ±1 mm or more unless secondary sizing is done. That said, an experienced process can get decent results. For a shaft, maintaining roundness and straightness might be challenging if one end is being spun – supports or steady rests are needed. Shear spinning (a variant) intentionally thins the wall to a set ratio by maintaining a fixed gap between the roller and mandrel – that can yield a uniform thickness but still might have ±10% variation. In contrast, flow forming was the evolution to improve that, using CNC and multiple rollers for precision. In any case, spin formed parts likely need to be measured and possibly calibrated if high precision is required. If used for a motor shaft, the critical sections (like bearing fits) would absolutely be machined after, so the spinning only needs to be accurate enough to leave enough material for machining cleanup. The less critical parts (like mid-shaft profile) can remain as spun. So one might spin form to get a near shape, then finish machine the ends and any precise diameter.
Mechanical Properties: Conventional spinning typically is done with minimal cold work compared to flow forming; it tends to shape without drastically thinning. So the material properties remain close to the initial sheet/tube properties, possibly with some work hardening on bent/flanged areas. There isn’t a big strengthening effect unless shear spinning is done (which then is akin to flow forming, causing appreciable cold work). Many spinning operations apply intermediate anneals to avoid cracking, which reset any work hardening. So the final spun shaft likely needs a separate heat treatment to reach desired strength. It doesn’t inherently improve structure like forging. However, it also doesn’t introduce large stress or defects – spun parts can be quite sound. If anything, a benefit could be that the spinning action might create compressive residual stress on the outer surface (due to bending), but this is marginal. For NEV shafts that likely require hardened surfaces, spinning would just be shaping step, followed by the regular heat treat that grants mechanical properties. So while forging and flow forming had big intrinsic property boosts, spinning is more neutral. The microstructure after spinning (if done cold) will be slightly worked and elongated, which might help yield strength a bit. If done hot, it’s similar to any hot worked part. In summary, one should treat a spin formed shaft as equivalent to the parent material properties, then plan heat treatments accordingly. There is no fiber alignment benefit unless the shape naturally causes it (like drawing out a flange). But since it’s axisymmetric, not much directional advantage except maybe circumferential orientation if any.
Surface Finish: Spinning can produce quite smooth surfaces if done properly. The roller tool burnishes the metal as it flows, often leaving a fine spiral or radial line pattern. Typically, the finish is comparable to a turned surface. If the mandrel is smooth and the roller is smooth, the contact can almost polish the metal. However, manual spinning can leave some discrete tool marks if the tool is paused or moved unevenly. Overall, though, spinners achieve good finish – an advantage of spinning processes is excellent surface roughness, often better than other forming methods ([[PDF] FLOW FORMING: A REVIEW OF RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES ...](https://iaeme.com/MasterAdmin/Journal_uploads/IJMET/VOLUME_7_ISSUE_5/IJMET_07_05_029.pdf#:~:text=,compared with other)). No metal is removed, so there are no chatter marks, just a flowing pattern. Many decorative or thin-walled items (like lighting reflectors) are spun precisely because it yields a smooth result that might not need polishing. For a shaft, the interior surface would remain as it was (if starting from a tube) or have the finish of a drawn cup interior (which is decent). The exterior from spinning could be near-net. But since one likely machines the OD for precision, the finish benefit might not be fully utilized on critical sections. Still, having a smooth near-net surface means machining cuts can be lighter. So spin forming is fine in terms of surface quality – no concern there, likely a slight better finish than a typical forging because of the nature of flowing the metal.
Post-Processing: A spin-formed shaft will need similar follow-up as others: heat treatment to achieve final strength (if it started soft) and machining of features and precise sections. Spinning likely won’t create holes or splines, so those must be machined or added (unless one does something like spin-form a pre-splined tube, but that’s unusual). Also, any excess material at the edges (a spun flange rim or such) might be trimmed. If the shaft was spun from a flat disc into a tube shape, one end was closed initially – that closed end would be cut off or bored out to make it a through-shaft. Thus, additional machining or punching is needed to open holes or cut to length. Because spin forming is often for one-piece seamless shapes, welding/joining is not part of the primary process (it avoids needing to weld, which is a plus). If the shaft design needed more complexity than spinning can handle, one might do a hybrid: e.g., spin form a tube to create a certain shape, and friction weld another piece to it for a spline end. But that’s case-specific. Typically, after spinning and heat treat, turning, milling, and grinding finalize the shaft. There may also be a balancing step if needed (sometimes small asymmetric features are added to balance, but motor rotors usually are balanced at assembly). If spinning was used, likely it’s because the shape was not easily made by forging or extrusion – but once it’s spun, the rest of manufacturing looks similar to other routes (machining and treat).
NEV Compatibility: Traditional spin forming is less commonly applied to parts like motor shafts, which are generally straight or have minor steps. However, if an NEV shaft had, say, a bell-shaped end or integrated rotor hub, spinning could form that bell from a tube. One scenario: Consider a motor shaft that also serves as part of a fan or has a wide portion to support a rotor lamination stack – spinning could expand one end of a tube to that larger diameter instead of welding a flange. This would result in a one-piece shaft with a shape that forging or machining from solid would find difficult without waste. So spin forming can provide geometric flexibility. It’s also useful in prototyping new designs due to low tooling cost. For NEVs focusing on weight, spinning doesn’t inherently reduce weight aside from enabling hollow shape (which other processes do too). It doesn’t improve strength, but it also doesn’t harm it significantly. It is likely a secondary option when other methods (like flow forming or forging) are not available or economical for the required volume. If a company lacks expensive forging setups, they might spin-form and weld to achieve a similar result at low volume. In terms of performance, a spin formed shaft is still a seamless, one-piece part, so it can meet the reliability needs. The precision might be lower prior to machining, but final machining solves that. It’s worth noting that spin forming was historically a craft but now with CNC, it is more controlled, yet flow forming is generally seen as the superior method for tight tolerance hollow cylindrical parts ([ Flowforming Yields Precision, Accuracy and More | PMF Industries, Inc. ](https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#:~:text=The difference between flowforming and,are neither predictable nor repeatable)). Because the question distinguishes spin forming, we treat it separately: it’s essentially a lower-precision, flexible forming method that could be applied to hollow shafts in special cases. To ensure NEV requirements (balance, strength) are met, any spin-formed shaft would be carefully finished. In conclusion, spin forming is a viable manufacturing route especially for low-volume or prototyping of hollow shafts or for shapes not easily made by other means, but for high-volume NEV production it’s likely to be supplanted by more precise processes like flow forming or precision forging ([ Flowforming Yields Precision, Accuracy and More | PMF Industries, Inc. ](https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#:~:text=The
Powder Metallurgy (Press & Sinter, Powder Forging)
Process: Powder metallurgy (PM) broadly covers making parts by compacting metal powders in a die and sintering them into a solid. This differs from MIM mainly in how the powder is handled (no injection of binder, usually just pressing in a mold). For hollow shafts, PM could be employed in several ways:

Conventional Press and Sinter: A die with a core rod could press a powder into a shape that includes a central hole (much like making a gear blank with a hole). However, the aspect ratio (length to diameter) is limited – pressing a long hollow shaft in one go is impractical due to ejection and density issues. Short hollow parts (like hubs or gear-like shapes) are done widely in PM, but a long shaft might need to be made in sections or with multiple presses along length which is complex.
Powder Forging: A hybrid where a powder preform (often lightly sintered or “briquetted”) is forged to full density in a die. For example, one could press a hollow cylinder to some density, then hot forge it onto a mandrel to get a dense hollow shaft. This can yield properties akin to wrought forging and is used for things like connecting rods in engines.
Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP): Densifying powders in a capsule uniformly with high pressure gas. A hollow shape could be made by HIP by using an appropriately shaped capsule, but this is usually for specialty materials, not mass production.
Additive Manufacturing (3D printing): Though not explicitly asked, this is also a powder-based approach to create hollow shafts (e.g. via laser powder bed or binder jet). It’s a form of PM, but since not listed, we won’t focus on it.
Considering typical automotive practice: many drivetrain components are made by PM (sintered) for high volume, like certain gears, sprockets, bushings. Hollow shafts via PM could be feasible if they are not too long – for instance, a short hollow input shaft with internal splines could be pressed and sintered, perhaps then copper infiltrated or surface hardened. Also, Fine Sinter (JP) indicates complex hollow sections can be made by sintering and brazing sub-parts with precision ([Powder Metallurgy | Business | Fine Sinter Co., Ltd.](https://www.fine-sinter.com/en/products/pmp/product/#:~:text=Powder Metallurgy ,precision%2C complex shapes as)), meaning multiple PM pieces can be joined to form a hollow assembly.

Suitable Materials: PM most commonly uses iron-based powders (plain iron, iron-carbon, iron-copper, iron-nickel steels) for structural parts. These can be blended to approximate alloy steels. For example, FC-0208 (iron with 2% copper, 0.8% carbon added during sintering) is common in gears. Also Ni-Mo alloyed powders (46xx series) that mirror low-alloy steels like 4605 are used, which can be heat treated after sintering. Stainless steel powders are used for special parts (not as strong as alloy steel). There are also powder mixes for high density that have fine powders or added graphite, etc. For a high-performance shaft, one would likely use a low alloy steel powder that can achieve high density and then quench & temper or carburize. If using powder forging, one could even use higher alloy content since forging will ensure full density. Powder forging connecting rods used a mix similar to 0.5% C steel plus some nickel, achieving properties similar to 4140. So materials are available to meet typical shaft properties. Another angle: if one wanted a soft magnetic composite shaft (for reduced eddy currents), there are iron-phosphorus powders that compress into shapes and have magnetic permeability but lower eddy losses; however mechanical strength is lower – likely not for a high-stress shaft. In summary, PM offers ferrous materials primarily that can replicate steel behaviors if densified well.
Production Volume & Cost: Traditional PM (press/sinter) is extremely cost-effective at high volumes. The tooling (die sets) are expensive, but each press stroke (which can be a second or two) yields a part that just needs sintering. Sintering is done in a continuous furnace for mass production (thousands of parts per hour possible with multiple presses). So per-part cost is very low for large runs – that’s why PM is used for millions of automotive parts (like ABS sensor rings, pulleys, small shafts in transmissions, etc.). For hollow shafts, if design allows pressing, volumes of tens or hundreds of thousands could justify it. A challenge is if the shaft is long, multi-level tooling is needed (with moving punches to form different diameters along length). This increases tooling complexity and cost. PM excels in making parts up to about 3:1 height-to-diameter ratio in one press; beyond that, achieving uniform density is tough. One might segment the shaft into two pressed parts (e.g. left half and right half of shaft, each with a hollow and some feature) and sinter-braze them together to form a longer hollow shaft ([Powder Metallurgy | Business | Fine Sinter Co., Ltd.](https://www.fine-sinter.com/en/products/pmp/product/#:~:text=Powder Metallurgy ,precision%2C complex shapes as)). Sinter-brazing is a process where parts are pressed separately, then stacked with a brazing filler, and during sintering they bond into one piece. This could make a more complex hollow assembly. The cost for that is still quite low at high volume, as multiple small parts are easier to press. Powder forging has an intermediate cost profile: you need a press and dies for forging, plus the powder compaction step. It was used in high-volume for automotive (e.g. millions of connecting rods by GM), so it can be efficient. Essentially you cut out waste compared to bar forging (less machining, near net shape) but have added steps of handling powder. If the mechanical demands are high, powder forging might be chosen to get full density and best properties. For moderate volumes, PM isn’t usually done – it’s not worth making the tooling for a few thousand parts (MIM or machining would take that range). So PM’s sweet spot is very high volume production, where it shines in cost per part. If an NEV model required an inexpensive motor or gear drive and needed some hollow shafts, PM could be a way to mass-produce a budget-friendly component. For performance-driven shafts, PM might be less common unless it’s powder forged to not compromise on density.
Dimensional Accuracy: Press and sinter PM parts are fairly precise in dimensions in-plane (diameters and profiles determined by the die) – often ±0.1 to 0.3 mm. The biggest issue is managing shrinkage or growth during sintering. Some sintered steels grow a bit due to pores. But with calibration, one can hit tolerances. Usually, PM parts are sized or coined after sintering to get exact dimensions: a hollow part might be re-pressed quickly in a die to ensure the bore and OD are spot-on. So accuracy can be very high after sizing, similar to a fine machined part. One must also consider that straightness could be an issue for a long slender part; sintering can cause slight bending if support isn’t perfect. But short, stubby hollow parts (like a shaft that’s short relative to diameter) will keep shape. Achieving a smooth bore in PM might require a sizing/honing step because the surface might have 5-10% porosity if not fully dense. But if high density (95%) is achieved, finishing might be minimal. Powder forging yields near fully dense parts that then can be machined like any forging – its initial accuracy is that of the forging die (maybe ±0.3 mm), but then it’s machined. So if powder forging a shaft, treat the accuracy similar to normal forging (with subsequent machining making it precise). In terms of detail, PM dies can create splines, keyways, steps, and even threads in the pressed part (threads usually need chasing though). So a lot of geometry can be net shape. For example, a sintered hollow input shaft for a gearbox could have a molded internal spline that just needs slight sizing to fit. The tolerance on that might be a few tenths of a mm, which can be met by sizing. So PM can deliver near-net shapes that require minimal finishing (perhaps a reamed bore and a ground journal). If very tight tolerances or surface finish are needed, a light machining is done, but usually PM tries to avoid heavy machining because the surface layer may contain porosity (though small). Summarily, PM can achieve good dimensional accuracy for complex shapes, but often relies on a secondary calibration step for highest precision.
Mechanical Properties: The mechanical properties of PM parts depend largely on density. A fully dense powder-forged part can equal wrought properties. A typical sintered steel at 85% density (common for low-end PM) would have much lower strength (400 MPa UTS) and not be suitable for a critical shaft. But improved powders and techniques now routinely achieve >90% density on structural parts, and with infiltration or resin impregnation, they can be boosted. Also, density can be tailored in pressing – for instance, end regions of a part can be pressed denser (for strength) and middle less dense (to save weight). However, for a rotating shaft, variable density might cause imbalance, so likely uniform high density is desired. Modern high-performance PM can yield 7.4 g/cc density (steel is 7.85 g/cc fully dense). Those parts, when heat treated, can have tensile strength in the 600-800 MPa range, and with case hardening, adequate fatigue performance. They will still have micro-pores, which can initiate cracks under very high stress or long life fatigue. Therefore, for a heavily loaded motor shaft, one might prefer powder forging to eliminate pores. In powder forging, a lightly sintered slug (maybe 80% dense) is placed in a die and forged to full density, closing pores entirely ([USES OF POWDER METALLURGY IN RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ...](https://www.teamxlr8ju.com/post/uses-of-power-metallurgy-in-recent-developments-in-vehicles#::text=USES OF POWDER METALLURGY IN,used in the automobile sector)). The result is akin to a conventional forging with possibly even better grain refinement (from starting powder). These can be heat treated to high strengths (e.g., powder forged connecting rods handle thousands of engine cycles). A specific note: a patent or two exist on making hollow shafts by forging a sintered preform, indicating that approach is considered for parts requiring axial holes ([[PDF] NOVEL HOLLOW SHAFT MANUFACTURING METHOD](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/45/d9/d8/6a600c526a36d3/EP3854517A1.pdf#:~:text=The hollow shaft manufacturing process,low stock utilization rate of)). PM also allows using alloys that are hard to forge – e.g., high chromium steel – but then sintering those to full density is the challenge. If a sintered (not forged) part is used as a shaft, likely it would be carburized to both harden the surface and somewhat sinter-bond any remaining porosity on the surface (carburization can fill some pores with carbides). This increases surface strength and fatigue. In general, a sintered shaft can work in moderate stress applications (there are sintered camshaft lobes, etc., though those are often PM + joining). But for an NEV main motor shaft which sees high torque, a fully dense solution (forged, or MIM, or machined) is usually the go-to. Still, for smaller shafts or ancillary shafts, PM is feasible. For example, some PM automotive parts boast high strength and durability for gears, shafts, and structural components in engine/transmission ([Metal Injection Molding | Materials and Properties](https://www.newayprecision.com/blogs/metal-injection-molding-materials-and-properties#:~:text=Applications%3A Low alloy steels find,undergo heavy loads and wear)). So the capability is there when density and alloy are optimized.
Surface Finish: Sintered surfaces have a matte, granular appearance due to tiny porosity and particle facets. They are not as smooth as wrought surfaces. They can be improved by sizing (which burnishes the surface a bit) or by secondary operations like grinding or plating. In a shaft application## Manufacturing Techniques for Hollow NEV Motor Shafts
To evaluate each technique, the table below compares key factors – materials, cost/volume suitability, precision, mechanical properties, surface finish, and typical post-processing. All processes assume the shaft is made from a steel alloy (e.g., low-carbon or alloy steel) suitable for heat treatment, unless noted otherwise:

Process	Materials (Typical & Suitable)	Production Volume & Cost (Low, Med, High volume viability; cost drivers)	Dimensional Accuracy (As-formed tolerances, concentricity)	Mechanical Properties (Strength, grain flow, etc. vs. base metal)	Surface Finish (Roughness, quality as formed)	Post-Processing Needs (Heat treat, machining, etc.)
Cold Drawing (Seamless tube)	Steels (low-carbon, alloy), stainless, etc. Must be ductile for cold work.	High volume – Very cost-effective for long tube production. Moderate tooling cost (dies), low per-piece cost at scale. Low/Med volume – Buy standard drawn tube (cheap). Custom sizes less economical at low qty.	High precision – Tight OD/ID tolerances, excellent concentricity. Uniform wall thickness. Minimal distortion. Typical tolerance ~±0.1 mm or better.	Work-hardens metal: increases yield & tensile strength. May introduce residual stresses (often stress-relieved). Grain structure elongated along length; improved axial properties, slightly reduced ductility (can anneal if needed).	Smooth surfaces – Very good finish inside & out. Often polished-like; Ra in low μm range. No scale (cold process). Little to no machining needed for surface quality.	Cut to length, then machine ends/features (splines, threads, etc.). Heat treat (Q&T or carburize) usually after machining to reach final hardness. No welding needed (one-piece seamless tube).
Hot Extrusion	Steels (carbon, alloy), aluminum, Ti, etc. Billet heated ~1100–1300 °C for steel.	High volume – Efficient for mass production of constant profiles. High initial die cost, but low per-unit cost if run continuously. Low volume – Less practical unless using standard tube sizes (due to setup costs).	Moderate precision – Good initial profiles, but more variation than drawing. OD/ID tolerances ~±0.5% typically. May require secondary sizing (cold draw or machining) for tight tolerances. Straightness needs checking.	Refined grain from hot work, but essentially recrystallized (no retained strain hardening). No seams (good fatigue). Properties uniform, but as-extruded strength is lower than cold-worked. Heat treat usually needed for high strength.	Fairly smooth but with oxide scale and minor die lines. Better than rough forging, but not as smooth as cold-drawn. ID typically smooth (formed by mandrel). OD has matte hot-finish, often descaled.	Cut to length, possible cold draw or straighten if needed for size. Machining of ends/features is required. Heat treatment (normalize, then Q&T or case harden) to develop strength. No welding; one-piece hollow.
Rotary Swaging (Radial forging)	Steels (annealed or mild for forming), Al, etc. Cold or slightly warm process; high-strength alloys can be swaged in steps.	Low to High volume – Flexible for various batch sizes. Quick changeover, moderate tooling (dies, mandrels) ([Rotary swaging - Felss](https://felss.com/en/technologies/rotary-swaging/#:~:text=Advantages of the rotary swaging,process)). Med volume ideal – high throughput with CNC swagers; low scrap (material redistributed, not cut). Economical per part (no flash waste).	High accuracy – Produces precise diameters and complex profiles via incremental forming. Typically within ±0.05–0.2 mm. Excellent concentricity (mandrel support for ID). Often no further sizing needed on formed sections.	Significant cold work -> strength ↑ and fatigue strength ↑ up to 30%. Work-hardening raises hardness; grain flow follows part shape, improving load capacity. Lightweighting: can thin walls mid-shaft (up to 50% weight savings) with maintained strength. May need stress relieve for ductility.	Good finish – Smooth, slightly ridged texture from dies. Workpiece surface is cold forged, often no machining needed. No scale, clean surface. Internal surfaces also smooth if mandrel used.	Possibly none for shape – swaging can near-net form features (steps, tapers). Only finish machine critical fits (e.g., bearing journals) if needed. Heat treat: Either swage after anneal then harden, or swage as final cold-work and just stress-relieve. No welds (unless attaching other parts later, usually not needed).
Flow Forming	Steels (annealed low-alloy, stainless), Inconel, Ti, Al, etc.. Preform typically a thick-walled tube or cup.	Medium to High volume – Cost-effective at scale: low waste, one-piece near-net shape. Some upfront cost (custom mandrel) but reduced machining & material lower overall cost. Flexible CNC process, suitable for mid-volume; for very high volume, multiple machines used.	Excellent precision – Wall thickness and profile controlled to ±0.05–0.1 mm. Long parts with L/D > 2.5:1 achievable with minimal deviation. Concentricity and straightness are very high (ID mirrors mandrel exactly). Little to no runout.	Major cold work => Strength and hardness greatly increase (often 2–3× base material). Grain structure stretched axially, boosting tensile and fatigue performance. Can achieve thin walls with high strength (allows weight reduction). Must watch reduced elongation (~15% after heavy forming) ([		


Flowforming Yields Precision, Accuracy and More | PMF Industries, Inc.
]([https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#:~:text=After%20a%2060%20percent%20reduction,original%20product%20specification%20may%20have](https://www.pmfind.com/news/flowforming-yields-precision-accuracy-and-keeps-an-operation-competitive#:~:text=After a 60 percent reduction,original product specification may have))); typically followed by appropriate heat treat to optimize properties. | Very smooth ID (mandrel finish Ra 0.5–1 µm). OD also smooth (drawn tube quality) with fine tool marks, no cutting lines. No welds or seams, hence uniform surface. Often acceptable as-is or with minimal polishing. | Minimal machining – Preform design can include near-net features. Possibly need to trim ends, cut keyways, or machine spline teeth that couldn’t be formed. Heat treat usually applied (Q&T or case harden) to relieve stress and set final properties unless as-formed properties suffice. No welding needed (unless designing multi-piece assembly, e.g., two flow–formed halves laser-welded). | | Hydroforming (Tube hydroform) | Ductile steels (mild, HSLA, annealed alloy), stainless; also Al extrusions. Requires good plasticity for expansion. | High volume – Suited for mass production of complex shapes (common in auto frames). High tooling cost (matched dies) but can replace multi-part assemblies (saves cost in welding & parts). Low volume – Not economical due to expensive press and dies per shape. | Good near-net shape – Conforms to rigid dies: diameter expansions typically ±0.3–0.8 mm. Good concentricity and repeatability (low springback on tubes). Fine details limited by die design (no sharp internal corners without special techniques). | No inherent strength boost (deformation is biaxial stretch). Expanded areas thin out – slight work-hardening but also reduced cross-section. Material properties ~ equal to initial tube, unless post-forming heat-treated. Advantage: no seam welds (unlike welded tube), so fatigue performance is continuous. For high-strength, will rely on base tube strength + subsequent heat treat. | Smooth exterior – Takes on finish of die surface, eliminating draw marks. No male-female die scuffing = smoother than stamped parts. Interior unchanged from starting tube (so use seamless drawn tube for a smooth ID). No scale (room temp process, though tube may be pickled). | Trim ends if sealed during forming. Machine any features not formed (e.g., end splines, precision bores). Hydroforming can form complex hollow shapes, but often join with forged ends: e.g., inertia weld forged spline stubs to a hydroformed tube. Heat treat if required (often tube is annealed state, so needs Q&T or case hardening after forming). | | Metal Injection Molding (MIM) | Wide range: low-alloy steels (e.g., 4140, 4605), stainless (304L, 17-4PH), Ti, superalloys. Powder feedstock is molded then sintered to high density. | High volume – Best for mass production of small/medium parts with complex geometry. High tooling cost (molds), but multiple cavities can boost output. Low per-part cost at scale. Low volume – Not economical (except via prototype tooling or binder-jet 3D printing). | Near-net shape – Molds yield precise complex shapes (±0.3% typical). Fine details like splines can be molded in. Shrinkage during sinter must be controlled; often achieve ±0.1–0.3 mm. Straightness can be an issue for long parts (may require straightening or support during sinter). Usually some features are slightly oversized for finish machining to tight tolerances. | High strength possible if fully dense. Sintered to 96–99% density – properties approach wrought (can reach >1000 MPa tensile after heat treat for alloy steels). Any residual porosity can lower fatigue strength; critical for rotating shafts. Mitigation: design for full density (perhaps via hot isostatic press if needed) or ensure geometry avoids stress raisers. Can heat treat (carburize, Q&T) like normal steel. | Good as-molded finish – replicates mold surface; after sintering, surfaces are matte with fine grain texture. Typically Ra ~5–10 µm. No machining marks, but micro-porosity makes it slightly less smooth than wrought. If needed, surfaces can be tumbled or polished. Many MIM parts are used as-sintered if appearance and tolerance are acceptable. | Debind & Sinter (in furnace) are part of process; then usually heat treat to achieve required hardness/strength. Sizing/coin critical dimensions after sinter (pressing to calibrate shape). Minor machining if needed (bore reaming, thread tapping, grinding of journals) – avoid heavy machining to keep cost advantage. No welding – part is one piece, though could be combined with others if needed (rare). | | Conventional Forging (Open or Closed-Die, incl. precision forging) | Steels (carbon, alloy), some Al or Ti. Hot forged (steel ~1150 °C). Hollow achieved via mandrels or punching. | High volume (closed-die) – Requires expensive dies, but excellent for mass production once tooled (e.g., transmission shafts). Low unit cost at large scale. Precision forging adds cost but reduces finish machining. Low volume (open-die) – Used for custom/large shafts; high per-part cost due to machining and material waste (but no custom die). Mid volume – Viable using standard preforms (e.g., forge from tube stock to reduce waste). | Near-net shape (closed-die) – Can hold ~±0.3–0.5 mm on critical features in precision forging. Typically leaves ~1–3 mm stock for finish machining. Grain flow ensures concentricity of features; if forged on mandrel, good concentricity of bore. Open-die forging + drilling relies on machining for precision. | Excellent – Refined grain and aligned flow improve strength and fatigue. A one-piece forging has high toughness and fatigue life (grain follows part contours). Forging from a hollow preform (tube) improves material yield (up to 68% vs ~30% from solid bar) and shortens process, without sacrificing strength. Final heat treat achieves very high strength. | As-forged: Oxide scale and die imprint -> rough surface. Closed-die parts have parting line flash. Not suitable as final finish. Precision forging yields smoother surfaces than regular forging but still requires smoothing for critical surfaces. Surface will be completely cleaned up by machining or grinding in most cases. | Trimming (for flash) and pickling/blasting (to remove scale). Machining of all critical dimensions: bore (or deep hole drilling if not pre-formed), OD surfaces for bearings/seals, threads, splines (unless forged to net and just need finish grind). Some splines/gear teeth can be forged nearly net, then just honed or ground. Heat treat (Q&T or carburize) then final grind of hardened surfaces. No welding – shaft is one solid piece (unless design uses welded sub-parts, generally avoided for motor shafts). | | Spin Forming (Metal spinning) | Aluminum, copper, mild steel, annealed alloy steels. Often done cold; heat can be applied for hard metals. | Low/Med volume – Low tooling cost (just a mandrel) suits custom or small batch parts. Labor/machine-time intensive per part (minutes each), so for high volume not as economical unless automated CNC spinners are used. Typically used for prototypes or specialized shapes rather than millions of identical parts. | Moderate precision – Relies on skilled control or CNC; typical tolerances ±0.5–1 mm (improved with experience or secondary calibration). Thickness can vary if not carefully controlled. Good roundness but less control of exact wall thickness vs. flow forming. Usually requires final machining of precise features. | Minimal intrinsic change – If just shaping without major thinning, properties remain near base material. Some cold work at formed areas (slight strength increase, residual stress). No strategic grain refinement like forging (fibers follow general shape but not a focused benefit). Usually will need full heat treatment after forming to achieve high strength. | Smooth – Spinning process can leave a polished, smooth surface (like a fine turned finish) with slight spiral marks. No cutting, so no chatter; surface often satisfactory cosmetically. Interior surface unchanged if starting from tube; if starting from flat blank (to make a cup), interior will have smooth drawn finish. | Trim/cut after forming (e.g., remove closed-end if a tube was spun from a blank). Heat treat if material was soft (most likely, yes – will need Q&T or hardening after to meet strength). Machining – required for any tight tolerance areas (bearing fits, etc.) and to add features (threads, splines) which spinning can’t create. No welds (one-piece forming). | | Powder Metallurgy (Press & sinter, or powder-forged) | Iron-based powders (plain iron, Fe-C, Fe-Cu, Fe-Ni-Mo). Low-alloy PM steels (e.g., FN-0205, FC-0208, diffusion alloy grades). Stainless PM blends, etc. Often sintered at ~1120 °C in controlled atmosphere. | High volume – Extremely economical for mass production. Complex multi-level part shapes can be made with single press stroke + sintering. Dies are costly but last long; per-part cost is very low for millions of parts (e.g., ABS ring gears, etc.). Low volume – Not cost-justified due to tooling, except for specialty powder forged parts or if using additive manufacturing (not in scope). | Near-net shape – Pressing yields final geometry within ~±0.1–0.3 mm in-plane. Need to account for sintering shrink. Generally, sizing can calibrate critical dims to < ±0.05 mm. Long shafts are hard to press in one piece (may make in segments). For short hollow parts (gear hubs, etc.), excellent consistency part-to-part after sintering ovens. | Dependent on density: Standard sintered parts (85-92% dense) have lower strength than wrought (pores act as stress concentrators). Higher density (>95%) achievable via powder forging or double-pressing; those can match wrought properties. Heat treatments (carburizing, quenching) substantially improve strength of PM steel, and infiltration or HIP can nearly eliminate porosity. In practice: PM parts can be very strong (used in engines, transmissions) but a fully dense route (e.g., powder-forged) is preferred for a critical high-torque motor shaft. | As-sintered – Surfaces are matte/granular due to slight porosity. Fine details are well-formed, but texture is not glossy. Roughness maybe Ra 5–15 µm. Usually “green” appearance (gray) unless steam oxidized or plated. Not as smooth as machined; functional surfaces may be post-processed (sized, ground). | Sintering (in furnace) to bond powder. Often followed by sizing (coining) to refine dimensions and improve surface density. Heat treat: many sintered alloys are carburized or induction hardened to boost surface strength and fatigue. Machining: minimal if designed well – e.g., holes, splines can be as-pressed. But often light machining of bores or threads, and grinding of journals for high precision. Possible joining: segments can be sinter-brazed to form complex hollows, or powder-forged onto a wrought piece, etc. |

Discussion of Each Technique
1. Cold Drawing: Produces seamless tubes with high precision and excellent surface finish. It’s ideal for obtaining a near-finished hollow shaft blank with minimal waste. Cold drawing is very cost-effective for creating the basic hollow at medium/high volumes because it yields long lengths that can be cut into many shafts. The drawing process enhances strength via work-hardening but may require a stress relief anneal. The drawn tube can then be machined to final dimensions and heat-treated. For NEV shafts, a drawn tube provides a lightweight, seamless starting point with good dimensional control, making it easier to achieve balance and concentricity in the final shaft. The lack of a weld seam is a big advantage for fatigue life and reliability. One limitation is that drawing alone cannot form complex end features or large flanges – those must be machined or fabricated separately. In summary, cold-drawn tubing is an excellent base for hollow shafts, offering precision and low cost, typically combined with machining and heat treatment steps to meet all requirements.

2. Hot Extrusion: An extruded hollow (seamless pipe) can be the initial form of the shaft. Extrusion shines in making hollow profiles in one hot working step, even for alloys that are hard to cold-form. It’s well-suited to high volume because once the tooling and process are set, extrusion can continuously produce lengths of hollow stock relatively cheaply. The process results in a one-piece, defect-free tube (no welds) which is good for strength. However, extruded parts have only moderate as-formed precision; typically, they would be subsequently cold-drawn to refine dimensions and surface, or simply machined. The mechanical properties after extrusion are improved over cast (refined grain, no casting voids), but not as high as forged or cold-worked – thus, a heat treatment is used to strengthen the shaft. A noteworthy use of extrusion is to create near-net hollow preforms that can then go into a forging process, or to produce custom alloy tubes that drawing facilities might not offer. For NEV applications, using extruded tubing could make sense if a special size or material is needed in mass (e.g., a high-strength stainless shaft for certain motors). In practice, many hollow shafts might source commercial seamless tubing (often made by hot extrusion + piercing) as their feedstock. Hot extrusion ensures good material integrity and can be cost-effective in large runs, but usually isn’t the final step for precision surfaces.

3. Rotary Swaging: This is a highly advantageous process for creating hollow shafts, particularly for achieving variable profile shafts with enhanced properties. In rotary swaging, a solid rod or thick tube is incrementally forged down to the desired shape, which can include steps in diameter and even internal features (with a mandrel). The big benefit is the material property improvement: swaging increases fatigue strength and hardness through cold work and grain refinement. It also allows lightweighting – e.g., by thinning the wall in the mid-span of a shaft where full thickness isn’t needed, thus cutting weight by up to half. Swaging equipment can produce parts with excellent repeatability and is suitable for automated production. For example, Felss (a swaging technology leader) achieved a 90° shoulder on a hollow shaft with high accuracy by combining swaging, hardening, and grinding. Swaging is generally limited by the amount of reduction per pass; extreme changes may need multiple stages or intermediate anneals. But it can form splines or contoured inner bores by using shaped mandrels, often eliminating the need to cut those features. For NEV shafts, rotary swaging offers a way to get a one-piece shaft with integral features (like splines, steps) without welding, and with superior strength. It is particularly well-suited if the design calls for a tapered or stepped shaft: swaging can economically produce that from a uniform tube. The process has relatively low material waste (only a short scrap piece at the end, if any) and thus high material utilization. In summary, rotary swaging is a strong candidate for manufacturing hollow motor shafts, as it aligns with the goals of weight reduction and strength improvement while being cost-effective for moderate to high volumes.

4. Flow Forming: Flow forming is one of the most precise and performance-enhancing methods for hollow shafts. By starting with a thick tubular preform and flow-forming it, one can achieve extremely tight tolerances and a fine surface finish on a long, thin-walled part. Moreover, flow forming orients the metal’s grain in the axial direction and induces significant cold work, raising the shaft’s strength and fatigue resistance considerably. This directly benefits an EV motor shaft, which sees cyclic torsion and bending – the flowformed microstructure can handle these better than a normalized structure. The technique also yields a seamless, weld-free part (especially important if the shaft doubles as a conduit for coolant or if any imbalance from welds must be avoided). From a cost perspective, flow forming can consolidate what might otherwise require multiple steps (like forging + boring or welding pieces together). For example, one EV rotor shaft design by Netform uses two flow formed halves laser-welded to create a hollow shaft, leveraging flow forming’s strength increase to allow thinner walls and lighter weight. They reported the flow forming process increased material strength by a factor of 2–3 over the base metal, enabling a weight reduction while maintaining torque capacity (NETFORM's Two-Piece Hollow Rotor Shaft - NETFORM). This illustrates how flow forming meets NEV needs: stronger, lighter shafts with integrated design features. The process does require an investment in a precise machine and tooling (mandrel), and each new shaft geometry needs a new mandrel. But for production, especially high-end applications (performance EVs, where efficiency and weight are premium), the benefits in part quality and performance often outweigh the costs. Flow forming is highly recommended for hollow shafts that require long, thin sections with excellent properties, such as those found in high-speed motors or where minimizing rotor inertia is crucial. Many automotive suppliers already use flow forming for components like clutch housings and transmission drums to exploit similar benefits.

5. Hydroforming: Hydroforming is a compelling option when the shaft design includes shapes that are not achievable via simple tubes – for instance, a hollow shaft with a larger mid-section diameter or an integrated flange. Hydroforming can expand a tube into a more complex shape in a single piece, avoiding circumferential welds. For example, a stepped hollow shaft (two different diameters along its length) can be hydroformed from a uniform tube, ensuring a smooth transition and continuous material. The advantages are that it can create shapes with high dimensional consistency and smooth surfaces while eliminating multi-part assemblies. Automotive industries have leveraged tube hydroforming for engine cradles and frame components for decades; in those applications, replacing multiple welded parts with one hydroformed piece improved quality and reduced cost at scale. For a motor shaft, hydroforming might be slightly less common, but consider an integrated rotor shaft that also acts as an oil distributor or has an internal cavity – hydroforming could produce that integrated cavity or outlets without needing to weld on fittings. The tolerances are not as tight as flow forming (some slight thinning occurs and must be tolerated or compensated in design), but usually a hydroformed part will be finish-machined where precision is needed. A drawback is that hydroforming requires heavy presses and robust dies – a significant capital expense. Thus, it’s mostly justified for high-volume production where each shaft is identical and the design is locked in. Another challenge is that material thinning in corners can reduce local strength; this must be addressed either by initial tube thickness (designing the tube thicker so that post-expansion thickness is acceptable) or by using axial feed during forming to thicken walls in expanded areas. For NEVs, hydroforming aligns with the drive for efficiency if it consolidates parts (for instance, combining a shaft and cooling channel in one) or if it allows using thinner base tubes that expand where needed (material only where it’s structurally necessary). In conclusion, hydroforming is a niche but valuable process for hollow shafts with complex geometry, particularly suited to high-volume scenarios where its per-part costs become low and the design benefits from one-piece construction.

6. Metal Injection Molding (MIM): MIM is an advanced process that could theoretically produce a hollow shaft with very complex features in one piece – for example, a shaft that has internal splines or cross-holes that would be challenging to machine. The strength of MIM is its design freedom and ability to yield near-net complex shapes with minimal machining. If one had an unusual motor shaft design (perhaps incorporating internal cooling fins or a non-standard shape) and needed high volume, MIM might be an option. However, typical motor shafts are relatively long and not extremely intricate externally, which is not MIM’s sweet spot. MIM parts also have size limitations; large slender parts are harder to mold without distortion or incomplete densification. More practically, MIM could be used for smaller hollow shafts in subsystems (like an actuator or small electric motor), where dimensions are smaller (a few inches). MIM’s material properties, once the part is sintered and heat-treated, can be very good – automotive-quality MIM low-alloy steels can reach 95%–100% density and be carburized to high surface hardness. MIM has been successfully used in automotive for things like gearboxes and locking mechanisms, indicating its reliability. For a main drive motor shaft in an EV, though, challenges would be ensuring full densification to avoid any risk of porosity-induced failure at high loads. This could involve additional steps like Hot Isostatic Pressing (which would add cost). The economics favor MIM for mass production of complex small parts, but for a relatively straightforward part like a shaft, the cost benefit over, say, machining a tube or forging might not be there unless the shaft integrates other functions that save cost elsewhere. In summary, MIM is a specialty route for hollow shafts – viable if the design is complex and the volume is high enough to amortize tooling, but otherwise likely not the primary choice. Traditional processes yield higher intrinsic strength (fully wrought material) without the complexity of sintering. MIM would more likely be considered if an EV motor design came up with a highly optimized shaft that conventional machining or forging couldn’t easily produce. In most NEV cases, more conventional metal forming methods suffice.

7. Forging (Open-Die, Closed-Die, Precision): Forging is a classic and proven method to produce the toughest shafts. Closed-die precision forging can near-net shape a hollow shaft, including features like flanges or splines, with grain flow following those features, thus maximizing strength where needed. Modern approaches use hollow starting stock to forge hollow shafts efficiently. The cited patent process demonstrates using a high-strength seamless steel pipe as the billet for forging: after a few forging stages, a hollow motor shaft with flanges and even internal spline teeth was formed, cutting the stock waste in half and eliminating multiple operations compared to forging from solid. This showcases how forging technology has adapted to make hollow parts more economically. The result is a part with forging-level reliability (no internal defects, optimal grain orientation) and much better material utilization. In high-performance NEV motors that output very high torque, a forged shaft is a safe bet – it will have the best combination of tensile strength, impact toughness, and fatigue endurance after heat treatment. One disadvantage historically was extra machining (drilling out the center, etc.), but that is mitigated by the hollow preform approach and by precision dies that minimize excess material. In terms of cost, forging wins for large-scale production where tooling is justified and the part complexity demands it. For example, if the shaft has a gear or spline as an integral feature, a forging can form it close to shape, whereas machining it from bar after drilling a hole would waste a lot of material. Open-die forging + deep drilling is less relevant to NEVs because it’s typically for very large shafts (like ship propeller shafts or wind turbine shafts) – NEV motor shafts are smaller and can be closed-die forged. If production volume is moderate (thousands), forging is still feasible, especially if using standard tube billets. If volume is low (hundreds), then forging may be expensive per unit, and one might revert to machining tubing or other simpler methods. Nonetheless, for mission-critical structural integrity, forging is unparalleled. Many automotive drivetrain shafts (for transmissions, axles) are forged to ensure they handle shock loads; an NEV motor shaft can similarly benefit. Therefore, forging (especially using tube-based precision forging) is often among the most suitable routes for NEV hollow shafts, marrying quality with efficiency – it yields a durable shaft with optimized fiber structure and requires only finish machining and heat treatment to meet all specs.

8. Spin Forming (Metal Spinning): Conventional spinning is somewhat an earlier iteration of what flow forming achieves in a more controlled fashion. Spinning could be used to form a flange or a tapered section on a hollow shaft. For instance, if an electric motor’s shaft needed a bell-shaped end to mount to a flywheel or a pulley, spinning an existing tube could create that bell without welding on a separate piece. The process is flexible and low-cost in terms of tooling, so it’s useful in prototyping or low-volume custom shafts. However, when it comes to precision and repeatability, spin forming is not as robust as other methods – wall thickness can vary because controlling material flow by a single roller is less exact than using CNC rollers in flow forming. For high-volume NEV manufacturing, relying on manual or even CNC spinning might introduce more variability than desired, affecting balance or requiring more post-process corrections. Also, spinning typically doesn’t significantly strengthen the part (unless it crosses into shear spinning, which is basically what flow forming is). So a spin-formed shaft usually still needs a full strength heat treatment cycle. It also cannot create fine details like splines or threads. As such, one might view spinning as a complementary process: for example, one could spin form a particular shape on the shaft and then combine it with other processes (like machining or welding a forged end). But by itself, spin forming would rarely be the entire manufacturing route for a motor shaft in volume production. It might be applied in special cases: perhaps for joining two dissimilar materials (spinning one over another), or for lining a steel shaft with another metal via spin bonding. In standard scenarios, the techniques like swaging or flow forming cover the same needs with better control. Overall, spin forming’s role in NEV hollow shafts is likely limited to prototype development or very unusual shapes. For most production intents, its more advanced cousin (flow forming) or other forming methods would be chosen.

9. Powder Metallurgy (PM): Conventional press-and-sinter PM is heavily used in automotives for parts like bearing caps, synchronizer hubs, etc., but less so for critical high-stress shafts. The main reason is that fully dense, high-fatigue-strength parts are hard to get by sintering alone – there’s usually 5–10% residual porosity that can reduce fatigue life. Powder forging addresses that by fully densifying the part with a forging hit after a preliminary sinter, and this approach has been used for things like connecting rods and gears, which are as critical as shafts. A hollow shaft could be made by powder forging, for example by pressing a ring-shaped preform and forging it on a mandrel to create the final hollow shape (some patents discuss similar concepts). At that point, it effectively becomes equivalent to a forged shaft (with perhaps even better micro-cleanliness, since starting from powder filters out large inclusions). If an NEV manufacturer wanted to use PM to reduce waste and cost, they might consider powder forging hollow shafts in high volume. It could potentially combine the net shape advantage (like forming splines or steps without machining) with full density. Also, PM allows mixing alloy powders to get a desired composition easily (like adding nickel for toughness). On the other hand, pure press-and-sinter without forging might be used for a lower-stress hollow shaft or one in a mild hybrid or accessory motor. In such a case, the shaft would likely be of a simpler shape (cylinder with some features) that could be compacted in a multi-level die and then carburized. The cost per piece would be very low for, say, 100k+ parts/year. Fine Sinter Co. even advertises forming hollow sections by combining and sintering parts, implying that complex hollow assemblies (like a shaft with an integral gear) could be made by PM and brazing in one furnace pass. That could significantly reduce assembly steps. However, the uncertainties in porosity and the need for 100% consistency to avoid any potential weak spots might make EV engineers cautious. If used, PM parts would undergo rigorous quality checks (density checks, perhaps CT scanning for internal defects on sample basis). In terms of NEV efficiency, PM has the advantage of near-net shaping which lowers machining (hence energy use and cost) and usually very high material usage efficiency (little scrap, any scrap can be recycled as powder). It is also quite repeatable in high volume manufacturing, yielding parts with less than 1% dimensional variation easily. In conclusion, PM is feasible for hollow shafts especially in very high volumes or for integrated designs, but ensuring mechanical performance comparable to wrought might require the powder-forging variant. PM could be the method of choice for small EV motor shafts or auxiliary shafts where loads are modest, or in cost-driven applications like e-scooters or light EVs where manufacturing economy is paramount. For a high-power EV drive motor, one would likely prefer a forging or flow formed shaft and not take on the risk of porosity unless the PM process is proven to deliver fully dense, strong parts.

Recommended Manufacturing Routes for NEV Hollow Motor Shafts
After comparing all techniques, the most suitable manufacturing routes for hollow motor shafts in electric drive units are those that best balance performance (strength, accuracy) with cost-efficiency and scalability. Often, a combination of processes can be employed to harness the advantages of each. Here are recommended approaches:

Flow Forming + Heat Treatment (Optimal for High-Performance, Medium/High Volume): For a one-piece hollow shaft with excellent strength-to-weight ratio and precision, flow forming followed by appropriate heat treatment is a top choice. Flow forming yields a near-net shape that may only need minor machining (like cutting splines or threads) and imparts superior mechanical properties (grain refinement, work hardening). A final quench and temper can tune the hardness and relieve any work strains. This route is ideal for high-speed motors requiring perfect balance and strength. It has been shown to considerably improve weight, strength, and cost metrics over traditional methods. For example, a flowformed shaft might be case-hardened to get a tough core (from the cold work) and a hard surface for wear. This approach minimizes material waste and ensures consistency. It’s being successfully applied in industry (e.g., Netform’s flowformed EV shafts), making it a proven solution.
Precision Forging from Tube + Minimal Machining (Optimal for Very High Loads or High Volume): Using a hollow seamless tube as the forging billet, perform multi-stage precision forging to create the shaft shape, then machine critical surfaces. This hybrid method combines forging’s fiber alignment and strength with the efficiency of starting from a tube (which drastically reduces waste and extra forging steps). The forged shaft, after trimming, would undergo normalizing (if needed), then machining of the bearing journals, inner bore finish, and any fine details. Subsequent carburizing or induction hardening would give a hard, fatigue-resistant surface, and final grinding ensures perfect dimensions. This route is recommended for high-torque shafts where maximum toughness is needed (for instance, in heavy EVs or performance models). It’s also well-suited to mass production – once the process is established, each shaft is made with minimal variation and high throughput. The cited novel process achieved ~68% material utilization and 50% cycle time reduction vs. conventional forging by using this method, demonstrating its efficiency. Thus, tube-based precision forging + finish machining is a robust route that meets NEV requirements for strength, accuracy, and volume.
Rotary Swaging (Cold) + Heat Treat (Great for Medium Volume, Complex Profile Shafts): For shafts that have varying diameters along their length or require exceptional fatigue life, rotary swaging is recommended. One can start with either a tube or solid bar (if starting solid, a hole may be drilled partway and then expanded during swaging). The swaging process can produce the final shape (with maybe a few millimeters extra for polishing). After swaging, perform a stress-relief anneal or low-temp temper to remove any excessive stresses but retain the work-hardening benefits. Then, if the steel grade calls for it, do a final quench & temper for through-hardening or case harden if a hard surface is needed. Because swaging already increases hardness, the heat treat can be adjusted (maybe temper at a higher temperature to achieve the desired final hardness). A final grind or hone on critical surfaces ensures exact size and surface finish. This route is suitable for medium volumes (a few thousand to tens of thousands annually) where investment in large forging presses might not be justified, but the part complexity or performance demands are high. Swaging equipment is more accessible, and the process is quick per piece. The result is a lightweight yet strong shaft (owing to the swaging-induced grain refinement) that meets the dynamic requirements of EV motors. It’s a lower-cost alternative to forging for moderate production scales, trading a bit of ultimate strength (since it’s not heated and re-quenched from scratch) for manufacturing simplicity and still high performance.
Cold-Drawn Tube + Machining (Good for Prototypes or Lower Volume): For initial development, prototyping, or low-volume production (for example, niche EV manufacturers or motorsport applications), simply using a high-quality cold-drawn seamless tube as a starting blank, then machining and heat-treating it, is a reasonable route. One would source a tube with suitable dimensions (perhaps slightly oversize wall to allow machining cleanup). Then: turn and mill the features (outer profile, any steps, and bore if tighter control is needed on the ID), perform any drilling (cross-holes for oil, etc.), and do a through-hardening or case-hardening heat treatment. Finally, grind critical surfaces for accuracy. This straightforward method leverages the excellent baseline accuracy and finish of drawn tube and doesn’t require specialized forming equipment – standard machine tools suffice. The mechanical properties will rely on the steel grade and heat treatment (the cold drawing provides some strength bump, but likely the quench & temper dominates final properties). The absence of forming operations beyond machining means no additional cold work benefits, but also no risk of forming defects. This approach is cost-effective up to a point: as volume grows, the material waste (chips from machining, especially if drilling out a lot of material) and machining time make it less attractive. But it is often used for initial runs and testing because it’s low risk and uses readily available materials. Many current EV motor shafts (especially those with straightforward geometry) are essentially made this way – gun-drilled from solid bar or machined from thick tube – for simplicity. It meets all performance requirements if done correctly (Tungaloy’s note on EV shafts highlights deep drilling in steel and subsequent hard machining). Thus, for smaller production runs or when flexibility is needed, machining from drawn tube is a solid choice, albeit not the most material-efficient.
Hydroforming Hybrid (For Complex Integration in High Volume): If the NEV motor shaft is part of a more complex assembly or needs integrated features (like a flange for a parking brake or a built-in coolant chamber), a combination route could be best. One scenario: Hydroform the mid-section of the shaft to create the complex geometry, then forge or machine the ends for splines and bearing surfaces, and join them (via friction welding or laser welding). For example, hydroform a lightweight tubular shape that has an expanded center (to support the rotor laminations or to hold a sensor ring), and separately forge solid end pieces for high-strength splined connections, then inertia-weld them to the hydroformed tube. This yields a finished shaft that takes advantage of hydroforming for the complex mid feature without multiple pieces or fasteners, and uses forging for the load-critical interfaces. The welds in such a design would be located in relatively benign stress areas (straight sections) and can be made very strong (inertia welds are nearly parent-metal strength). A similar approach is used in some drive shafts and axles (tube welded to forged yokes). The entire assembly would then be heat-treated if material properties allow, or the ends could be pre-hardened and the weld tempered. Another variant is hydroform + sizing + direct machining: hydroform the tube to near shape, then machine final features out of the thicker sections of the hydroformed piece. Essentially, the hydroformed shaft acts as a near-net blank that already has the general shape, and machining just refines it. This saves material (because you’re not starting from a huge solid forging) and can save some machining. Such a route is recommended if the shaft geometry allows significant optimization (weight or part count reduction) via hydroforming. It likely suits high volume production where the cost of the hydroforming die is justified and the design will remain stable (no frequent changes). In EV motors that have such integrated design philosophy (combining multiple functions into one part for weight savings), this could be the go-to method.
Powder Metallurgy / MIM (Special-case for Small or Complex Shafts in Extreme Volumes): Generally, for primary drive shafts, PM/MIM isn’t the first recommendation. But if we consider a scenario like an automaker producing millions of a small e-motor for auxiliaries or e-scooters, and each motor has a small hollow shaft that also has intricate geometry (say, a hollow shaft with internal gear splines or a one-piece rotor carrier shape), then a MIM or high-density PM solution might be optimal. In that case, one would design the shaft to be near-net by MIM, allowing for perhaps a sizing press and minor machining. A full sinter-HIP process could ensure near-100% density for strength. This approach would minimize post-process and achieve the shape in one go. It’s a high-risk, high-reward strategy: the risk is managing the shrinkage and achieving the needed fatigue life; the reward is incredibly low per-part cost once in steady production, and the ability to incorporate geometry that consolidates other components. This route is recommended only if the production volume is extremely high and other methods cannot easily produce the required shape or meet the cost target. For mainstream NEV drive units, this likely won’t be the case in the near term, but it’s worth noting as manufacturing technology evolves (especially as industry pushes toward more integrated, compact motor designs where shafts might have more features).
In conclusion, for most NEV hollow motor shafts today, the best approach is to use a forming process that provides a seamless, strong hollow preform (like flow forming, rotary swaging, or forging from a tube), followed by targeted heat treatments and minimal finish machining. This strategy yields a component that meets the stringent performance and efficiency demands – it will be lightweight (due to the hollow and any profile optimization), dimensionally precise (thanks to the near-net forming and final machine calibration), and mechanically robust (owing to favorable grain flow and hardening processes). Processes like flow forming and swaging also inherently improve surface hardness and finish, contributing to durability and reduced friction losses.

For extremely high-volume production where cost per part is paramount (and the design is simpler), using standard seamless tubing combined with efficient machining and perhaps innovative drilling methods (like gundrilling with minimal stock) can hit the required tolerances and properties at low cost. But as EV technology advances, we expect more manufacturers will adopt advanced forming (flow forming, precision forging) to gain the edge in weight and performance. These methods, while requiring upfront investment, pay off in the long run with shafts that enable motors to run smoother, last longer, and contribute to overall vehicle efficiency.
