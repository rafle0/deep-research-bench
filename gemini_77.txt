The Motivated Mind: Need for Cognitive Closure and Susceptibility to Misinformation
1. Introduction
The contemporary information landscape is characterized by an unprecedented volume and velocity of information, accompanied by a concerning rise in the prevalence and impact of misinformation across critical societal domains, including public health, political discourse, and environmental science.1 Misinformation, broadly defined as information counter to the best available evidence and expert consensus 1, poses significant challenges to informed decision-making, social cohesion, and democratic processes. Understanding why individuals accept and propagate information unsupported by facts is, therefore, a critical psychological and societal imperative. While factors related to information sources, content, and repetition play a role 2, research increasingly highlights the importance of individual differences in explaining differential susceptibility.

A central psychological construct implicated in navigating information and forming beliefs is the Need for Cognitive Closure (NFC). Conceptualized as a fundamental epistemic motivation, NFC represents an individual's desire for clear, definitive knowledge and a corresponding aversion to ambiguity, confusion, and uncertainty.7 It reflects a drive towards establishing and maintaining firm beliefs and knowledge structures, particularly when faced with open-ended or complex situations.7 As such, NFC stands as a key individual difference variable with the potential to significantly shape how individuals process information and, consequently, their vulnerability to accepting misinformation. The pervasive impact of misinformation 1 and the documented difficulty many individuals face in detecting false information 2 underscore the necessity of moving beyond generalized explanations for its acceptance. Investigating individual difference factors like NFC becomes crucial because susceptibility is not uniform.2 Understanding who is more vulnerable and why allows for the development of more targeted and effective counter-misinformation strategies. NFC, as a motivational factor influencing the very style of information processing adopted by individuals 12, offers a promising avenue for explaining these variations in susceptibility. Examining NFC provides a crucial lens for understanding the psychological architecture underlying belief in misinformation, moving beyond descriptions of the problem toward explanations rooted in cognitive motivation.

This report aims to systematically review and synthesize the psychological literature examining the role of NFC in the acceptance of misinformation. It will begin by providing a detailed definition of NFC, including its core characteristics, underlying processes, and measurement. Subsequently, it will define misinformation acceptance, differentiating it from related cognitive biases. The core of the report will then review the empirical evidence linking NFC to misinformation susceptibility, explore the psychological mechanisms proposed to mediate this relationship, and examine contextual and individual difference factors that moderate this link. Finally, the report will conclude with an integrated synthesis of the findings, highlighting the broader implications and suggesting directions for future research.

2. Defining the Need for Cognitive Closure (NFC)
2.1. Core Conceptualization
The Need for Cognitive Closure (NFC), primarily developed and elaborated by Arie Kruglanski and colleagues, refers to an individual's motivated desire for a firm answer to a question or resolution to a problem, as opposed to enduring states of ambiguity or uncertainty.7 It is fundamentally rooted in the human preference for predictability and the inherent discomfort associated with ambiguity.8 This "need" signifies a motivated tendency to actively seek out information or engage in cognitive processes that lead to closure.10 It represents a desire for stable, clear, and unambiguous knowledge structures.8 Crucially, NFC is conceptualized not merely as a cognitive style but as a motivation that energizes and directs cognitive activity, influencing how individuals acquire knowledge, form judgments, and make decisions.10 This motivational underpinning is central to understanding its impact on information processing and belief formation.12

2.2. Key Characteristics and Processes
The influence of NFC on cognition manifests through distinct processes and tendencies:

Seizing and Freezing: Kruglanski and Webster identified two primary epistemic activities driven by NFC: "seizing" and "freezing".8 Seizing refers to the tendency to quickly grasp onto initial pieces of information that afford closure, leading to rapid judgment formation, particularly when the need for closure is high.8 Individuals high in NFC may "seize" on the first available answer to alleviate the discomfort of uncertainty.8 Freezing refers to the subsequent tendency to maintain and protect that achieved closure, becoming resistant to subsequent information that might challenge or complicate the initial judgment.8 This "freezing" makes individuals less open to persuasion or alternative perspectives once a conclusion has been reached.16 These processes highlight how NFC dynamically shapes information processing, influencing both the initial formation and subsequent stability of beliefs.
Urgency and Permanence Tendencies: Underlying the seizing and freezing processes are two fundamental tendencies.10 The urgency tendency reflects the inclination to attain closure as quickly as possible, driving the "seizing" behavior.10 The permanence tendency reflects the inclination to maintain closure for as long as possible, protecting it from degradation or revision, thus driving the "freezing" behavior.10 These tendencies represent the motivational forces explaining why individuals high in NFC prioritize speed and stability in their judgments.10
Dispositional vs. Situational NFC: NFC is considered a relatively stable individual difference variable, meaning people differ consistently in their general desire for closure (trait NFC).10 However, the need for closure can also be temporarily heightened or lowered by situational factors (state NFC).10 Factors such as time pressure, environmental noise (e.g., distractions), cognitive load, task dullness, or the perceived importance of making a quick decision can increase an individual's momentary need for closure, leading even those typically low in trait NFC to exhibit seizing and freezing tendencies.10 This duality underscores the pervasive influence of NFC, operating both as a stable personality characteristic and a dynamic motivational state responsive to context.
2.3. Measurement: The Need for Closure Scale (NFCS)
To operationalize and measure individual differences in the dispositional need for closure, Webster and Kruglanski developed the Need for Closure Scale (NFCS).9

Development and Purpose: The original NFCS is a 42-item self-report inventory designed to assess stable individual differences in the desire for definite knowledge and aversion to ambiguity.9 Its purpose is to quantify the extent to which individuals possess this motivational tendency.9 Various shorter versions and revised scales have also been developed and validated, sometimes focusing on specific dimensions like urgency and permanence.12
Structure and Dimensions: The original scale was conceptualized as potentially tapping into five facets reflecting manifestations of NFC: (1) Preference for Order and Structure (e.g., "I think that having clear rules and order at work is essential to success"), (2) Preference for Predictability (Desire for Predictability and Security), (3) Decisiveness (Impatience or impulsivity regarding decision-making), (4) Discomfort with Ambiguity (e.g., "I do not like situations that are uncertain," "I dislike questions which could be answered in many different ways"), and (5) Closed-mindedness.10 Scores can be computed as a total NFC score by summing all items, or as subscale scores for each facet.15 Individuals scoring high tend to value order, dislike ambiguity, make decisions quickly, and hold strong opinions.15
Validity and Dimensionality Debate: While widely used and often showing good internal consistency 18, the NFCS has been subject to psychometric debate, particularly regarding its dimensionality. Although initially treated by its developers as essentially unidimensional, measuring a single latent construct 10, subsequent factor analytic studies suggested a multidimensional structure.10 Often, two broader, sometimes orthogonal factors emerge, such as Decisiveness and a factor combining aspects of ambiguity avoidance and need for structure.10 This debate is significant because using a total NFCS score might obscure potentially distinct relationships between different facets of NFC and outcome variables, complicating interpretation.10
Refining the Construct: Ability vs. Need: A specific critique focused on the Decisiveness subscale.16 Researchers argued that items traditionally used to measure decisiveness might primarily tap into an individual's perceived ability or confidence in making decisions, rather than the underlying motivational need for rapid closure that the theory posits.16 For instance, making decisions quickly could reflect competence rather than an urgent desire to escape ambiguity. To address this, new items were developed to explicitly probe the need for quick and unambiguous answers, separating it from perceived decision-making ability.16 Studies showed these new 'need' items formed a reliable scale and were predictive of the 'seizing' process, whereas the old Decisiveness scale was not, supporting the distinction between motivational need and perceived ability.16
The complexities surrounding the measurement of NFC carry important implications. The ongoing debate about its dimensionality suggests that different facets of the closure motivation might relate differently to outcomes like misinformation acceptance. For example, the desire to avoid ambiguity might be particularly relevant for the initial acceptance ('seizing') of simple, clear (mis)information, whereas closed-mindedness might be more strongly related to resisting corrections ('freezing'). Treating NFC as a single, monolithic construct by relying solely on total scores could mask these more nuanced relationships. Furthermore, the distinction between the motivational need for closure and the perceived ability to achieve it (particularly concerning decisiveness) is critical. If decisiveness reflects ability rather than motivation, its link to motivated reasoning processes becomes less direct. A person might be decisive due to high self-efficacy, not necessarily due to an urgent need to escape uncertainty. This distinction is vital for accurately understanding the psychological mechanisms connecting NFC to biased information processing. Consequently, researchers should exercise caution when interpreting findings based on total NFCS scores and consider analyzing facets separately, potentially utilizing revised scales that better capture the intended motivational components.12

3. Understanding Misinformation Acceptance
3.1. Defining Misinformation and its Acceptance
Misinformation can be broadly defined as "cases in which people's beliefs about factual matters are not supported by clear evidence and expert opinion".1 It encompasses false or misleading information, which can be spread intentionally (disinformation) or unintentionally.1 Misinformation acceptance, within cognitive psychology, refers to the process whereby individuals incorporate such false or misleading information into their memory representation of an event or into their broader belief system.21 This acceptance often leads to erroneous recall, recognition, or judgment based on the incorporated falsehood.21 It signifies that the misleading information has become part of the individual's subjective reality regarding the topic at hand.22

3.2. The Misinformation Effect Paradigm
The vulnerability of human memory to distortion by post-event information is powerfully demonstrated by the "misinformation effect" paradigm, pioneered by Elizabeth Loftus and colleagues.22 In the classic experimental setup, participants first witness an event (e.g., via video or slides). Subsequently, they are exposed to post-event information, which, for the experimental group, contains misleading details contradicting the original event. Finally, participants' memory for the original event is tested.22 A typical finding is that participants exposed to the misleading information are more likely to report the false details as part of their memory of the original event compared to a control group not exposed to the misinformation.22 This effect highlights how susceptible memory is to contamination from subsequent inputs.22

3.3. Mechanisms of the Misinformation Effect
Several cognitive mechanisms have been proposed to explain why the misinformation effect occurs:

Memory Impairment/Interference: Early theories suggested that the misleading information might overwrite or impair the original memory trace.22 Later views emphasized interference, where the misinformation hinders the retrieval of the original memory.21
Source Monitoring Errors: A widely endorsed account posits that individuals may remember the misinformation itself but misattribute its source.24 They might mistakenly recall the misleading detail as originating from the witnessed event rather than the post-event narrative.22 Forgetting the source of information is common.22
Misinformation Acceptance: This perspective suggests that individuals might accept the misinformation and report it, particularly if their original memory is weak or inaccessible, or if the misinformation seems plausible or comes from a credible source.24 They may consciously or unconsciously adopt the suggested information as their own memory, sometimes with high confidence.24 This acceptance plays a major role, especially when conditions allow for the creation of new, albeit false, memories.24
Factors influencing the magnitude of the misinformation effect include the time delay between the event and the misinformation (longer delays can increase susceptibility), repeated exposure to the misinformation (which increases perceived accuracy), and social factors like discussing the event with others who might introduce conflicting details.1

3.4. Distinguishing Misinformation Acceptance from Related Concepts
While related to other cognitive biases involved in belief formation and maintenance, misinformation acceptance possesses distinct characteristics:

Belief Perseverance: This refers to the tendency to cling to one's initial beliefs even after the original basis for those beliefs has been discredited or refuted by new information.26 The core focus is on the resistance to change established beliefs when faced with contradictory evidence.26 It involves maintaining prior conclusions despite evidence undermining them.27
Confirmation Bias: This is the tendency to actively seek out, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's pre-existing beliefs, hypotheses, or values, while simultaneously ignoring, downplaying, or scrutinizing contradictory information more harshly.26 The core focus is on the biased processing (search, interpretation, recall) of information relative to existing beliefs to maintain consistency.29
Misinformation Acceptance: This specifically involves the adoption and integration of novel, incorrect information into one's memory or belief system.21 It can lead to the formation of a new false belief or the distortion of an existing memory based on external misleading input.22 While confirmation bias might predispose an individual to accept misinformation that aligns with their existing views 28, misinformation acceptance itself is the process of incorporating the new falsehood. Belief perseverance describes what happens after a belief (potentially formed via misinformation acceptance) is challenged.
These distinctions are important because NFC might play differential roles across these phenomena. The core features of NFC—particularly the urgency tendency and the associated "seizing" mechanism 8—suggest a particularly strong link to the initial acceptance of misinformation. The drive for a rapid answer in the face of ambiguity 11 makes individuals vulnerable to quickly adopting readily available (mis)information as a means of achieving closure. While NFC's "freezing" tendency 8 undoubtedly contributes to belief perseverance (resisting belief change) and confirmation bias (preferring belief-consistent, certainty-enhancing information 18), its most direct and perhaps primary impact in the context of novel falsehoods might be on the initial uptake or integration process. Belief perseverance and confirmation bias primarily concern the maintenance and defense of beliefs already held, whereas misinformation acceptance describes the adoption of new, false ones – a process seemingly tailor-made for the "seizing" propensity of high-NFC individuals seeking immediate resolution. Recognizing these distinctions is crucial for designing interventions; strategies might need to target different NFC-related processes depending on whether the goal is to prevent the initial acceptance of falsehoods (countering seizing) or to correct existing false beliefs (countering freezing).

To clarify these distinctions, Table 1 provides a comparative overview.

Table 1: Comparison of Misinformation Acceptance, Belief Perseverance, and Confirmation Bias

Concept	Definition	Core Psychological Process	Relation to Existing Beliefs	Potential Primary NFC Mechanism Involved
Misinformation Acceptance	Incorporating novel false or misleading information into memory or belief system.21	Integration of new external falsehoods; potential memory distortion or false belief formation.	Forms new false beliefs or distorts existing memories.	Seizing (Urgency)
Belief Perseverance	Tendency to maintain existing beliefs even after the evidence supporting them is discredited or contradicted.26	Resistance to updating/changing established beliefs despite contrary evidence.	Protects existing beliefs from contradictory information.	Freezing (Permanence)

4. The Empirical Link Between Need for Closure and Misinformation Acceptance
A growing body of empirical research investigates the relationship between individual differences in NFC and the propensity to accept various forms of misinformation. Overall, the evidence suggests a generally positive association, indicating that individuals with a higher dispositional need for closure tend to be more susceptible to believing and accepting false or unsubstantiated information.

4.1. Overview of Findings Across Misinformation Types
Conspiracy Beliefs: Several studies have linked higher NFC, or specific facets thereof like discomfort with ambiguity and closed-mindedness, to a greater tendency to endorse conspiracy theories.3 The underlying mechanism often proposed is that conspiracy theories, despite being complex, offer seemingly simple, comprehensive, and certain explanations for complex, ambiguous, or threatening events (e.g., pandemics, political events), thereby satisfying the epistemic needs of high-NFC individuals.3 For instance, research on COVID-19 conspiracy theories found that beliefs in such theories mediated the relationship between fear of the virus and NFC facets like avoidance of ambiguity and closed-mindedness.3 Some models propose that epistemic mistrust in authoritative sources creates a vacuum that high-NFC individuals may fill by embracing alternative, conspiratorial narratives that provide a sense of understanding and closure.32
Fake News and Disinformation Belief: Research examining belief in "fake news" or politically motivated disinformation has also found connections with NFC. Studies indicate that higher NFC can be associated with greater difficulty in distinguishing between true and false news headlines 4 and a higher likelihood of believing fabricated news stories, particularly when the content aligns with one's pre-existing political attitudes or ideologies.33 One study found that exposure to counter-stereotypical information led to decreased cognitive reflection among individuals high in NFC, suggesting that encountering information challenging their structured worldview might backfire.20 Conversely, another study found that while negative misinformation had a strong impact, higher cognitive ability (which can counteract NFC tendencies) helped individuals adjust their attitudes after a retraction, whereas those with lower cognitive ability remained biased even after correction, an effect not accounted for by NFC itself in that study.5
Antiscience Attitudes: NFC may also play a role in the rejection of scientific information. Evidence suggests that scientific messages contradicting recipients' existing beliefs or presented in ways that mismatch their cognitive style, potentially including their NFC level, are more likely to be rejected.34 For example, communicating the inherent uncertainty in preliminary scientific findings, while accurate, might be particularly problematic for individuals high in NFC who crave definitive answers, potentially leading them to misinterpret or reject the information, or even infer and spread misinformation based on a naive understanding.6
Continued Influence Effect of Misinformation (CIEM): Misinformation often continues to influence reasoning and judgment even after it has been explicitly corrected or retracted.35 While direct studies linking NFC to the CIEM specifically are less common, the "freezing" tendency associated with high NFC—the motivation to maintain achieved closure and resist belief updating 8—provides a strong theoretical basis for expecting that high NFC individuals might be particularly prone to the continued influence of misinformation, finding it harder to discount the initial (false) information once closure has been achieved around it.
4.2. Consistency and Caveats
While the general trend points towards a positive association between NFC and misinformation acceptance, the findings are not entirely uniform. Some studies have reported null or inconsistent findings, particularly when examining specific facets of NFC or certain types of beliefs.32 For example, some research failed to find associations between NFC and belief in conspiracy theories 32 or between NFC and the "jumping to conclusions" reasoning bias sometimes linked to delusions.36 One study even found that the 'Decisiveness' facet of NFC was negatively associated with psychotic-like experiences, suggesting complexity in how different aspects of NFC relate to unusual beliefs.36

This variability highlights that the relationship between NFC and belief in false information is likely not a simple, direct main effect. It underscores the importance of considering the specific type of misinformation, the particular facet of NFC being measured, and the context in which information is encountered. For instance, the appeal of complex conspiracy theories might strongly engage the ambiguity-avoidance aspect of NFC 3, whereas the rapid acceptance of simple fake news headlines might be more driven by heuristic processing tendencies linked to the urgency aspect.37 Furthermore, the specific dimension of NFC under investigation matters; as noted earlier, 'Decisiveness' might operate differently than 'Discomfort with Ambiguity' or 'Closed-mindedness'.36 The context itself, such as the high uncertainty prevalent during a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic 3, might significantly amplify the role of NFC in driving individuals toward simplistic or unsubstantiated explanations. Therefore, a nuanced understanding requires moving beyond correlating total NFC scores with general measures of misinformation belief. Future research should focus on how specific NFC facets interact with distinct types of misinformation and various contextual factors to predict acceptance, avoiding the oversimplification that "high NFC causes misinformation belief."

5. Psychological Mechanisms Mediating the Relationship
Understanding why a higher need for closure leads to greater misinformation acceptance requires examining the psychological mechanisms through which this motivation influences cognitive processing. The core driver is the fundamental motivation itself, which then shapes how information is sought, evaluated, and integrated.

5.1. The Motivational Engine: Drive for Certainty and Ambiguity Avoidance
At its heart, the link stems from the defining characteristic of high NFC: the strong motivation to attain cognitive closure, achieve certainty, and escape the psychologically uncomfortable state of ambiguity or confusion.6 Misinformation, particularly in complex or uncertain domains (e.g., health crises, political turmoil), often presents itself in simple, clear-cut, and definitive terms.11 It offers seemingly straightforward answers or explanations that can quickly resolve ambiguity and provide a sense of understanding, directly catering to the epistemic needs of individuals high in NFC.3 The very act of communicating necessary scientific uncertainty or nuance, while epistemically responsible, can be problematic for this group, potentially increasing their tendency to misinterpret preliminary evidence or generate inferred misinformation in their quest for a solid conclusion.6 The discomfort with uncertainty motivates the search for any answer that provides closure.11

5.2. Cognitive Processing Consequences
This fundamental motivation shapes information processing strategies in ways that increase vulnerability to misinformation:

Increased Reliance on Heuristic Processing: A key consequence of high NFC is an increased tendency to rely on cognitive shortcuts, or heuristics, rather than engaging in effortful, systematic, and analytical processing of information.14 This preference for heuristic processing is particularly pronounced under conditions that heighten NFC, such as time pressure or cognitive load.11 Misinformation frequently exploits heuristic cues to gain acceptance, such as appealing to emotions, relying on source credibility (real or fabricated), leveraging social consensus (bandwagon effect), or benefiting from the processing fluency that comes with repetition (illusory truth effect).1 Individuals high in NFC, driven by the urgency for closure, are more likely to base their judgments on these readily available, superficial cues without engaging in deeper scrutiny of the information's validity.14 They may default to quicker, less effortful System 1 thinking rather than engaging deliberative System 2 processes.37
Reduced Information Seeking and Hypothesis Generation: The urgency to attain closure quickly discourages extensive information searching and the generation or consideration of multiple alternative hypotheses or interpretations.8 Individuals high in NFC may prematurely terminate their information search once they encounter a piece of information—even if it is misinformation—that provides an initial sense of closure.8 They "seize" upon the first plausible answer that reduces ambiguity, rather than investing the cognitive effort required to explore alternatives or complexities.8
Seizing and Freezing Dynamics: The "seizing" and "freezing" processes are central to the acceptance and persistence of misinformation among high-NFC individuals.8 Seizing facilitates the rapid initial adoption of misinformation because it offers a quick path to resolving ambiguity and achieving the desired state of closure.8 Once closure is attained around this (mis)information, the freezing tendency takes hold.8 Individuals become motivated to maintain this state of certainty and resist subsequent information or corrections that would challenge their belief, require cognitive effort, and potentially reintroduce the uncomfortable state of ambiguity.8 This dynamic helps explain why misinformation can be particularly "sticky" or difficult to correct for individuals high in NFC.5
These mechanisms suggest that NFC acts as a catalyst for heuristic-driven acceptance of misinformation. When faced with ambiguity, the high-NFC individual experiences discomfort, motivating a rapid resolution. This promotes reliance on low-effort heuristic processing over more demanding systematic analysis. Misinformation often employs strong (though potentially misleading) heuristic cues (e.g., confident tone, emotional appeal, familiar source, repetition). The high-NFC individual "seizes" upon the misinformation because it offers a quick resolution via these heuristics, achieving temporary closure. This reduces the motivation for further critical evaluation or correction, leading to "freezing" on the potentially false belief. Therefore, high NFC does not necessarily imply an impaired ability to detect misinformation but rather a reduced motivation to engage in the effortful cognitive processes required for accurate evaluation, making individuals more susceptible to the persuasive tactics commonly used in misinformation.

However, a further layer of complexity emerges when considering an individual's perceived ability to actually achieve closure. Research indicates that the positive relationship between NFC and heuristic processing might be moderated by the Ability to Achieve Closure (AAC) – an individual's self-assessment of their capacity to use information-processing strategies effectively to reach closure.14 According to this research, high NFC leads to increased heuristic processing primarily when individuals also perceive themselves as having the ability to use cognitive strategies effectively to get quick answers (high AAC). Conversely, for individuals high in NFC but low in perceived AAC (feeling unable to effectively process information for closure), the relationship might reverse or disappear; they might become less heuristic, perhaps due to frustration or awareness of their limitations.14 This interaction suggests that it is the interplay between the motivation for closure (NFC) and the perceived cognitive capacity to attain it (AAC) that ultimately determines the information-processing style adopted. Simply measuring NFC may not suffice to predict processing strategy; assessing AAC (or related constructs like domain-specific self-efficacy) could offer a more precise prediction of when high NFC will translate into reliance on potentially misleading heuristics.

6. Contextual and Moderating Factors
The relationship between NFC and misinformation acceptance does not occur in a vacuum. Its strength and manifestation are influenced by characteristics of the misinformation itself, the situation in which it is encountered, and other individual differences that interact with NFC.

6.1. Influence of Misinformation Characteristics
Emotional Content: Misinformation that evokes strong emotions like fear, anger, or outrage tends to be more readily believed and shared.2 For individuals high in NFC, who seek clear narratives, emotionally charged (mis)information might offer compelling, albeit simplistic, explanations for complex or upsetting events, potentially increasing its acceptance.
Repetition and Fluency: Repeated exposure to a statement, even a false one, increases its perceived truthfulness – the illusory truth effect.1 This effect is thought to operate via processing fluency: familiar information feels easier to process, and this ease is misattributed as a signal of veracity.37 Given that high NFC individuals prefer cognitive ease and rely more on heuristics 14, they may be particularly susceptible to believing misinformation simply because they have encountered it multiple times.
Congruency with Existing Beliefs: Information, including misinformation, that aligns with an individual's pre-existing attitudes, beliefs, or ideologies is significantly more likely to be accepted.1 This phenomenon, closely related to confirmation bias, likely interacts powerfully with NFC. Belief-congruent misinformation simultaneously satisfies the need for closure by providing a ready answer and reinforces the certainty and stability of one's existing worldview, making it doubly appealing to those high in NFC.
6.2. Situational Factors
Time Pressure and Cognitive Load: Situational constraints that limit cognitive resources, such as time pressure or multitasking, increase reliance on heuristic processing for everyone.37 These conditions can also temporarily elevate an individual's state need for closure.11 Consequently, such situations likely exacerbate the vulnerability to misinformation, especially for individuals already high in dispositional NFC.
Uncertainty Salience: Contexts characterized by high levels of ambiguity, threat, or uncertainty – such as pandemics, social crises, or major unexpected events – naturally heighten the collective and individual need for answers and explanations.3 In these situations, the definitive (though often false) closure offered by misinformation becomes particularly attractive, especially to those high in NFC who find uncertainty most aversive.6 Communicating necessary uncertainty during such times requires careful strategies to avoid inadvertently pushing high-NFC individuals towards misinformation.6
6.3. Individual Differences as Moderators
Several other individual characteristics can moderate the link between NFC and misinformation acceptance:

Cognitive Ability / Analytical Thinking: Higher cognitive ability, analytical reasoning skills (e.g., performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test), numeracy, and a disposition towards effortful thinking (high need for cognition) are generally associated with better discrimination between true and false information and reduced susceptibility to misinformation.2 These cognitive resources may provide the capacity to override the heuristic impulses driven by high NFC and engage in more careful, systematic evaluation when necessary.5 Conversely, lower cognitive ability is associated with greater difficulty in correcting the influence of misinformation even after it has been explicitly retracted.5 This suggests cognitive ability can act as a crucial buffer. High NFC creates the motivation for quick, heuristic acceptance, while high cognitive ability provides the means for more effortful scrutiny. Individuals high in both NFC and cognitive ability might experience conflicting drives, but their ability could enable them to overcome the NFC impulse if accuracy motivation is high or heuristics yield clear contradictions. Those high in NFC but low in cognitive ability appear doubly vulnerable, lacking both the motivation and the capacity for careful evaluation.5 Interventions aimed at boosting analytical thinking skills 4 could thus be particularly beneficial for mitigating the risks associated with high NFC.
Political Orientation / Ideology: While high NFC often correlates with conservative political ideologies and right-wing authoritarianism 5, its impact on misinformation acceptance seems primarily channeled through ideological congruency.4 That is, individuals high in NFC may be particularly susceptible to misinformation that confirms and reinforces their specific political worldview, regardless of whether that worldview is left- or right-leaning. The desire for a stable, predictable worldview inherent in NFC 18 aligns well with strongly held ideologies, which provide certainty. Therefore, high-NFC individuals may "seize" particularly strongly on ideologically congruent misinformation because it satisfies the need for closure and bolsters their identity-relevant beliefs simultaneously.2 This suggests an ideological amplification effect: misinformation targeting strong partisan identities may be especially potent among high-NFC individuals across the political spectrum. Some research also points to "motivated reflection," where higher analytical thinking is selectively applied to scrutinize ideologically incongruent information more than congruent information.4
Source Credibility: People are generally more likely to accept information from sources they perceive as credible, expert, trustworthy, or belonging to their in-group, and reject information from distrusted sources.2 Because individuals high in NFC tend to rely more heavily on heuristics 14, they may overweight source cues when judging information validity. Source credibility (or perceived lack thereof) acts as a powerful shortcut.34 A high-NFC individual seeking a quick judgment might readily accept information from a source deemed trustworthy (e.g., an authority figure, an in-group leader, a verified social media account 37) or swiftly reject information from a distrusted source, without deeply processing the message content itself. This makes them highly susceptible to manipulation via source cues, including misinformation laundered through seemingly credible channels or spread by perceived allies. Conversely, establishing trust in reliable sources is vital, but overcoming entrenched distrust among high-NFC individuals who have "frozen" on a negative source perception can be extremely challenging.34
Age and Education: The role of age is complex. Some studies suggest older adults share more misinformation online, yet other experimental work indicates they may sometimes be better, or at least no worse, than younger adults at judging the veracity of news headlines.2 Lower educational attainment has sometimes been linked to greater susceptibility to misinformation and related phenomena like antiscience attitudes.2 These demographic factors likely interact with underlying variables like cognitive ability, digital literacy, and potentially NFC.
Other Factors: Psychological states like anxiety have been linked to increased belief in misinformation, perhaps because anxiety heightens the need for certainty and control that misinformation seems to offer.1 General trust in institutions, media, and science also plays a role, potentially interacting with NFC and source perceptions.33
Table 2 summarizes key factors identified as moderating the relationship between NFC and misinformation acceptance.

Moderator	Observed Effect	Supporting References
Cognitive Ability / Analytical Thinking	Generally buffers against misinformation; may allow override of NFC-driven heuristics; low ability linked to persistent effects.5	2
Political Ideology / Congruency	Amplifies NFC effect for ideologically congruent misinformation; NFC often correlates with conservatism but effect is via congruency.	1
Source Credibility / Trust	High NFC individuals may rely heavily on source heuristics; acceptance higher for trusted/in-group sources, rejection for distrusted sources.	2
Situational Uncertainty / Crisis	Heightens ambient need for closure, making misinformation's simple answers more appealing, especially for high NFC individuals.	3
Time Pressure / Cognitive Load	Increases reliance on heuristics and state NFC, exacerbating vulnerability, particularly for high trait NFC individuals.	11
Information Repetition / Fluency	Creates illusory truth effect via processing fluency; high NFC preference for cognitive ease may increase susceptibility.	1
Emotional Content	Strong emotions increase acceptance; may interact with NFC's desire for clear narratives in charged situations.	2
Ability to Achieve Closure (AAC)	May moderate NFC-heuristic processing link; high NFC may only lead to heuristics if AAC is also high.	14
7. Synthesis and Conclusion
The evidence reviewed in this report converges on the conclusion that the Need for Cognitive Closure (NFC) plays a significant role in shaping an individual's susceptibility to misinformation. As a fundamental epistemic motivation driving the quest for certainty and the avoidance of ambiguity, NFC influences the very cognitive processes individuals employ when encountering and evaluating information. The core argument emerging from the literature is that a higher need for closure promotes reliance on cognitive shortcuts—heuristic processing and rapid "seizing" upon initial information—while simultaneously discouraging deeper analytical engagement, extensive information seeking, and belief updating in the face of contradictory evidence (manifesting as cognitive "freezing"). This combination of expedited, superficial processing and resistance to revision creates a cognitive pathway through which misinformation, often packaged with appealing heuristic cues and offering simplistic certainty, can gain acceptance and persist.

However, the influence of NFC is not deterministic. Its impact on misinformation acceptance is modulated by a complex interplay of factors. Crucially, cognitive abilities, particularly analytical thinking skills, appear to act as a potential buffer, providing individuals with the capacity to override the heuristic impulses driven by high NFC and engage in more careful scrutiny when warranted. Conversely, low cognitive ability may compound the vulnerability associated with high NFC. Contextual factors are also critical: situations characterized by high uncertainty, time pressure, or cognitive load tend to amplify the effects of NFC by increasing reliance on heuristics and heightening the desire for quick answers. Characteristics of the misinformation itself, such as its emotional resonance, repetition (leading to fluency), and congruence with pre-existing ideologies, leverage the processing tendencies favored by high-NFC individuals. Furthermore, perceptions of source credibility act as powerful heuristics, heavily weighted by those seeking rapid closure. The interaction between NFC and ideological commitment appears particularly potent, suggesting that high-NFC individuals may be especially prone to accepting misinformation that reinforces their cherished worldviews and social identities.

These findings have considerable implications for understanding belief formation and propagation in the modern information ecosystem. The cognitive tendencies associated with high NFC may contribute to broader societal phenomena, including the formation of polarized echo chambers (as individuals "freeze" on ideologically congruent narratives), resistance to evolving scientific consensus (due to aversion to uncertainty and complexity), and the rapid spread of rumors and conspiracy theories during crises (as people "seize" on readily available explanations to reduce anxiety).

While the link between NFC and misinformation susceptibility is increasingly well-documented, several limitations and avenues for future research remain. Much of the research relies on self-report measures of NFC, and further validation using behavioral or implicit measures could be beneficial. The correlational nature of many studies makes definitive causal claims challenging, although experimental manipulations of state NFC provide stronger evidence for its causal role. Research employing more diverse samples beyond typical undergraduate or Western populations is also needed. Future investigations should prioritize:

Disentangling the distinct roles of different NFC facets (e.g., ambiguity aversion vs. decisiveness vs. closed-mindedness) using refined measurement tools.
Further exploring the interaction between NFC and the perceived Ability to Achieve Closure (AAC) to understand when NFC leads to heuristic versus other processing strategies.
Developing and rigorously testing interventions specifically tailored to mitigate misinformation susceptibility among high-NFC individuals. Such interventions might need to combine training in analytical thinking skills with strategies aimed at increasing tolerance for ambiguity or managing the discomfort it evokes.
Investigating more deeply the role of NFC, particularly the "freezing" tendency, in the context of misinformation correction and belief revision. Understanding how to effectively "unfreeze" beliefs held with certainty by high-NFC individuals is a critical challenge.
In conclusion, the Need for Cognitive Closure represents a significant psychological factor influencing how individuals navigate the complexities and ambiguities of the information environment. By promoting a preference for certainty, simplicity, and cognitive ease, high NFC can inadvertently lower the threshold for accepting misinformation. Recognizing the role of this fundamental cognitive motivation is essential for developing a comprehensive understanding of why misinformation proves so persuasive for some individuals and for designing more effective strategies to foster informed beliefs in an era increasingly defined by information overload and uncertainty.
