Shoujo Manga and Linguistic Expression: Investigating Pronoun and Particle Use Among Queer Young Adults in Japan
Introduction
Purpose and Scope
This report investigates the potential influence of consuming shoujo manga (Japanese comics primarily targeting girls and young women) on the specific linguistic choices made by queer young adults in Japan. The analysis focuses on two key grammatical categories that are significantly gendered in the Japanese language: first-person pronouns and sentence-ending particles. The central aim is to explore whether the distinct patterns of gendered language often depicted in shoujo manga correlate with or influence how this particular minority group utilizes these grammatical features for personal expression, particularly in relation to gender identity. The investigation encompasses several key areas: a description of standard gendered language norms in contemporary Japanese; an analysis of the characteristic linguistic styles found within popular shoujo manga, comparing them to standard usage and shonen manga (comics primarily targeting boys); an examination of linguistic practices and identity expression within the queer young adult community in Japan; an assessment of shoujo manga consumption patterns among this group; a review of existing research exploring links between media consumption (especially manga/anime) and language use among queer individuals in Japan; consideration of broader theories on mass media's influence on language variation and change; and identification of other significant factors (e.g., peer interaction, online communities) that shape the language of queer young adults in Japan.

Context: Gendered Language in Japanese
The Japanese language possesses distinct linguistic features and styles conventionally associated with different genders, often referred to as onna kotoba (女言葉, "women's words") or joseigo (女性語, "women's language") and danseigo (男性語, "men's language").1 These differences are most pronounced in informal, spoken Japanese and manifest prominently through the choice of first-person pronouns (ways of saying "I") and sentence-ending particles (suffixes that add nuance, emotion, or force to utterances). Generally, language associated with women is perceived as softer, more polite, or deferential, while language associated with men is often perceived as rougher, more assertive, or direct.1 The historical development of these gendered norms is complex, with some research tracing the standardization of certain forms, like the association of specific pronouns with male versus female speakers, back to the Meiji era (1868–1912) and the creation of a national language (kokugo) that prioritized male speakers as primary citizens.4 While gender differences are minimal in formal written Japanese and polite spoken forms (teineigo) 1, they remain a salient feature of casual interaction and a resource for identity construction.

Context: Media Influence and Language Change
The role of mass media in shaping language variation and change is a subject of ongoing debate within sociolinguistics.6 While traditional views often emphasize the primacy of face-to-face interaction in driving fundamental linguistic shifts 7, the increasing pervasiveness and interactivity of modern media, including the internet and social media, have prompted renewed investigation into media's potential influence.6 In the Japanese context, manga and anime are frequently cited, particularly in popular discourse, as potential sources of linguistic innovation or change, especially concerning youth language, slang, and the performance of gender.10 However, empirical research often suggests that media may reflect existing linguistic trends as much as, or more than, it drives them.6

Focus Group: Queer Young Adults in Japan
This report specifically examines the linguistic practices of queer (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary/X-gender, and other non-heteronormative or non-cisgender identifying) young adults in Japan. Studying this demographic offers a unique lens through which to explore the intersection of media influence, language use, and identity expression. As a minority group navigating societal norms around both gender and sexuality, their linguistic choices, particularly concerning heavily gendered grammatical categories like pronouns and particles, can provide valuable insights into how individuals utilize available linguistic resources to construct and perform identities that may diverge from mainstream expectations. Furthermore, certain segments of the LGBTQ+ community in Japan face relative invisibility in mainstream society and research 14, making an analysis of their cultural consumption and linguistic expression particularly pertinent.

I. Gendered Language Norms in Contemporary Japanese
A. First-Person Pronouns: Inventory, Gender/Formality Associations, Usage Contexts
Japanese possesses a notably richer inventory of first-person pronouns (1PPs) compared to the singular "I" in English.16 The selection of an appropriate 1PP is a complex sociolinguistic act, influenced by a confluence of factors including the speaker's perceived gender, age, the formality of the situation, the speaker's relationship with the interlocutor, relative social status, the desired self-presentation or persona, and the specific conversational context.16

Normative Gendered Pronouns and Their Usage:

Watashi (私): This is the most standard and versatile 1PP, generally taught to learners as the default translation of "I".20 In formal or polite contexts, watashi is considered gender-neutral and appropriate for anyone.19 However, in informal or casual speech, its use is strongly associated with femininity.16 While men do use watashi, it is typically reserved for formal situations like business meetings or public addresses.4 If used by men in casual contexts, it may be perceived as stiff, overly polite, or potentially effeminate.18
Watakushi (私): Pronounced differently but often written with the same kanji as watashi, watakushi represents the highest level of formality.18 It is gender-neutral and employed in highly formal settings such as official speeches, business negotiations with high-status individuals, or ceremonial occasions.18
Boku (僕): This pronoun is normatively associated with masculinity and is commonly used by boys and men.4 Japanese schools often explicitly teach boys to use boku upon entering elementary school.5 It functions primarily in informal or semi-formal contexts and generally conveys a gentler, more humble, or boyish impression compared to ore.19 While predominantly used by younger males, adult men also use boku, although use by older men might carry connotations of "feeling young" or attempting to appear less imposing.18 Use by females is non-normative but occurs, often indexing tomboyishness or specific character personas in fiction.18
Ore (俺): Considered a strongly masculine 1PP, ore is highly informal and conveys assertiveness, confidence, and sometimes roughness or even rudeness depending on the context and addressee.5 Its use is typically restricted to interactions with close peers (especially male friends), family members, or individuals perceived as being of lower status.18 Amongst close relations, it can signal familiarity rather than superiority.18 It is frequently used by male protagonists in action-oriented anime and manga.22
Atashi (あたし): An informal feminine pronoun, derived from watashi.16 It is common in the casual conversation of younger women and girls and is perceived as softer or more casual than watashi.18 While primarily feminine today, historical usage included male merchants and artisans in the Edo period.18
Atai (あたい): A very informal, slang variant of atashi, strongly associated with femininity, sometimes with connotations of being rough or belonging to a 'bad girl' persona.18
Uchi (うち): An informal 1PP primarily associated with girls and younger women, particularly originating from Western Japan (Kansai region), though its use has reportedly spread.13
Jibun (自分): Literally meaning "oneself" or "self," jibun can function as a first-person pronoun.18 It is often considered gender-neutral, although some sources note it is used more commonly by males.1 Using jibun as a 1PP can sometimes convey a sense of distance, objectivity, or formality 18, but it can also be employed assertively 16 or strategically by individuals wishing to avoid explicitly gendered pronouns.1
Washi (儂): Primarily associated with elderly men, often appearing in fiction to denote age or in certain regional dialects (e.g., western Japan).18
Other Forms: A variety of other 1PPs exist, though many are archaic, literary, dialectal, or primarily used in fictional contexts. These include ware (我/吾, very formal/literary), waga (我が, "my/our," formal), sessha (拙者, samurai language, humble), soregashi (某, samurai language, humble), warawa (妾, archaic female, noblewomen/goddesses in fiction), and ora (おら, dialectal/fictional, associated with characters like Goku from Dragon Ball).18
Developmental Acquisition and Usage:

Young children in Japan typically refer to themselves using their given names (sometimes with suffixes like -chan or -kun), likely reflecting how they are addressed by family members.5 This practice is considered childish, and upon entering elementary school (around age six), children are usually instructed by teachers to adopt gendered pronouns: watashi for girls and boku for boys.5 This pedagogical reinforcement establishes watashi/boku as the normative binary for children. However, empirical studies reveal complexities. Mori's (2015) survey of five-year-olds found that while a majority of boys used boku (30%) or ore (35%), only 35% of girls used watashi, with 63% continuing to use their names.5 Mori suggested girls avoid watashi because it feels too formal (used by adult women) and too general (used by men formally), whereas boku and ore offer boys distinct ways to construct masculine identities.5 Furthermore, even after learning the norms, speakers frequently adjust their pronoun usage based on the situation and addressee. Studies show that girls and women, in particular, may use the normative watashi when speaking to authority figures like teachers or parents, but switch to non-normative pronouns—including uchi, atashi, or even the masculine boku or ore—when interacting with peers to enact specific identities or social positionings.5 This situational code-switching underscores the performative nature of pronoun selection in Japanese identity work. Some research suggests girls may use non-normative pronouns to postpone identification with adult female heterosexuality, which they associate with watashi.4

Historical Context:

The gendering of Japanese first-person pronouns is not an inherent linguistic feature but rather a product of historical and social processes. Research indicates that during the Meiji Restoration, the development of a standardized national language (kokugo) was tailored primarily for male speakers, reflecting the government's patriarchal ideology which positioned men as primary citizens.4 Linguists involved in this process tended to prescribe pronouns associated with masculinity (like boku) as standard, while feminized pronouns were excluded or marginalized, leaving watashi (originally more gender-neutral) as the default, albeit less prestigious, option for women.4 Over time, the distinct gender associations of watashi (for females) and boku (for males) were reinforced through social norms and education.5

Table 1: Standard Japanese First-Person Pronouns (Gender/Formality)

Pronoun	Kanji/Hiragana	Primary Gender Association	Typical Formality	Key Notes
watakushi	私 / わたくし	Neutral/Both	Very Formal	Used in highly official/business contexts.
watashi	私 / わたし	Neutral/Both (Formal)	Formal / Informal	Standard polite form. Perceived as feminine in casual speech.
Feminine (Informal)		
boku	僕 / ぼく	Masculine	Informal	Common for boys/men; gentler/humbler than ore. Non-normative female use exists.
ore	俺 / おれ	Masculine	Informal	Strongly masculine, assertive/rough; used with close relations/subordinates.
atashi	あたし	Feminine	Informal	Common casual form for women/girls; softer than watashi.
atai	あたい	Feminine	Very Informal	Slang version of atashi; can sound rough.
uchi	うち	Feminine	Informal	Primarily young women/girls, strong Kansai association but spreading.
jibun	自分 / じぶん	Neutral (Male-leaning?)	Neutral/Informal	"Oneself"; can convey distance or assertiveness; used to avoid gender.
washi	儂 / わし	Masculine	Informal	Associated with elderly men, dialects, or fictional characters.
The formal education system plays a significant role in cementing the watashi/boku binary as the standard for young speakers.5 Yet, the observed reluctance of many young girls to adopt watashi in early childhood, citing its formality, generality, or unwelcome association with adult heterosexuality 4, demonstrates an immediate tension between prescribed norms and lived experience. This suggests that the "standard" itself is contested territory from a very early age, even before significant external influences like mass media come into play. The negotiation of identity through language begins early, shaped by the available linguistic tools and their associated social meanings.

A structural issue within the standard Japanese pronoun system becomes apparent in casual peer interactions, particularly for girls. While boys have distinct informal options (boku, ore) allowing for different shades of masculinity 5, girls lack a widely accepted, designated informal pronoun that is both neutral and age-appropriate. They are often faced with choosing between the informal but distinctly feminine atashi or uchi, the potentially overly formal or feminine-coded watashi, reverting to childish name usage, or adopting non-normative masculine forms like boku or ore.4 The neutral jibun exists but carries specific connotations of "oneself" or distance that may not always fit.18 This gap forces speakers, especially girls, into actively navigating and potentially subverting the existing gendered system to express themselves among peers. Non-normative pronoun use, therefore, may not simply be an act of rebellion but a pragmatic strategy to fill a linguistic void or avoid labels perceived as unsuitable.

B. Sentence-Ending Particles: Inventory, Gender/Affective Associations, Usage Contexts
Sentence-ending particles (SFPs), or shūjoshi (終助詞), are a hallmark of Japanese grammar, appearing at the end of clauses or sentences to add a layer of pragmatic meaning or affective nuance.26 They can indicate assertion, ask questions, add emphasis, convey emotion, seek agreement, signal the speaker's stance towards the proposition or the listener, and crucially, mark the speaker's gender, particularly in informal conversation.1

Feminine Particles (onna kotoba/joseigo features):

Wa (わ): This is perhaps the most stereotypically recognized feminine SFP, particularly when uttered with a rising intonation.1 It typically conveys softness, politeness, emotional emphasis directed towards the addressee, or a delicate mood.1 Its use is generally confined to conversations between close individuals and is considered inappropriate in formal settings.1 Historically, it may have originated as a light, self-addressed confirmation, leading to an inferred open-endedness that softens assertion.3 However, its usage is reportedly declining among younger generations of women.26 It is important to distinguish this feminine wa from the wa used with falling intonation, which can be employed by male speakers (often older) for emphasis or exclamation, or found in certain dialects like Kansai-ben where it can be gender-neutral.1 Some recent studies even suggest male usage of the traditionally "female" wa might be increasing, albeit for different pragmatic functions (e.g., expressing personal emotion rather than building rapport).30
No (の): In declarative sentences, no can function as a feminine particle, softening the statement or adding a gentle explanatory nuance.1 Using no at the end of a statement is often perceived as feminine.34 When used to form questions (often with rising intonation), no is sometimes considered neutral 26, although it can still carry a softer or more intimate feel than the standard question marker ka. Dropping the declarative copula da before sentence-final no (e.g., kirei na no instead of kirei na n da) can also contribute to a feminine impression.28 Like wa, male usage of statement-final no has been observed, potentially serving different discourse functions.30
Kashira (かしら): This particle functions as a feminine equivalent of kana, expressing uncertainty or wondering ("I wonder if...").1 Its use is also considered to be declining, particularly among younger speakers.33
Wayō (わよ): A combination particle often cited as feminine, used for emphasis or assertion, potentially stronger than wa alone.28 Often found in fictional portrayals.28
Other Feminine Speech Features: Beyond specific particles, traditionally feminine speech is associated with more frequent use of honorific prefixes like o- and go- 1, a tendency to omit the plain copula da in informal speech 1, and potentially a higher overall pitch or specific intonation patterns.1
Masculine Particles (danseigo features):

Zo (ぞ): A strongly masculine SFP used for forceful assertion or emphasis.1 It carries an authoritative tone and is typically used when addressing perceived subordinates or among close male friends.1
Ze (ぜ): Also a masculine SFP conveying assertion or emphasis, but generally considered milder and more lighthearted than zo.1 Often used among male peers or buddies to create a sense of camaraderie.1
Yo (よ): While often categorized as a neutral particle used by both genders for emphasis, informing the listener, or making assertions 21, its use, particularly in the form da yo (だよ) following the plain copula, is frequently associated with masculine speech.1 It imparts information considered to be within the speaker's domain.1
Na (な): Functions as a masculine counterpart to the agreement-seeking particle ne.21 It can also combine with the question marker ka to form kana (かな), expressing uncertainty or wondering ("I wonder"), often associated with male speakers.1 Additionally, na (often elongated as nā) can indicate self-directed emphasis or emotional reaction.28
Sa (さ): A masculine particle, sometimes considered similar in force to ze, potentially used to state something considered obvious or matter-of-course.1
Kai (かい) / Dai (だい): Strongly masculine sentence endings used for asking questions.31 Kai is typically used for yes/no questions, while dai is used for open-ended (wh-) questions.31
Other Masculine Speech Features: Masculine speech styles often involve the use of the informal copula da instead of desu 1, less frequent use of honorifics 1, and sometimes phonological reductions (e.g., takai → takē, nai → nē).33
Neutral/Shared Particles:

Ne (ね): A very common particle used by all genders to seek agreement or confirmation ("right?", "isn't it?"), build rapport, or soften a statement.21 While gender-neutral, some observe it might be used more liberally by women.21 Duplicated at the beginning of a sentence (ne, ne!), it can sound feminine or cute.28
Yo (よ): As mentioned, often considered neutral, providing emphasis or new information to the listener.21 The combination yone (よね), merging the functions of yo and ne, is frequently used.28
No (の): When used to mark questions, particularly with rising intonation, no is often considered a neutral form usable by both genders.21
Contemporary Trends and Neutralization:

A significant trend observed in contemporary Japanese sociolinguistics is the move towards neutralization of gendered language, especially among younger speakers.3 Studies consistently report that younger women use stereotypical feminine forms (like rising-intonation wa or kashira) less frequently than older generations.26 Instead, they increasingly employ neutral particles (ne, yo, question no) or even forms traditionally considered moderately masculine (da, yo, na).3 Consequently, the use of strongly gendered particles like wa, zo, and ze appears to be becoming rarer in everyday conversation across all age groups and genders.26 This shift suggests that the traditional binary of onna kotoba and danseigo may be becoming less distinct in actual practice, particularly for SFPs.

This observed decline in the use of strongly feminine particles like wa and kashira, coupled with the increased adoption of neutral or even moderately masculine particles by younger women 3, points towards a significant societal evolution in linguistic gender expression. This phenomenon is not isolated but appears to be part of a broader pattern of language change potentially linked to shifting societal gender roles, a greater emphasis on gender equality particularly in professional and educational settings 24, or perhaps the standardizing influence of mass media favoring more neutral forms. This ongoing neutralization provides a crucial backdrop for understanding any potential media influence; media texts like shoujo manga might be reflecting or accelerating this societal trend rather than acting as the sole catalyst for change. Analyzing the language use of specific groups, such as queer young adults, requires acknowledging that they are participants in these larger sociolinguistic currents.

II. The Linguistic Landscape of Shoujo Manga
Shoujo manga, as a distinct category of Japanese comics targeting adolescent girls and young women 41, presents its own characteristic linguistic landscape. Analyzing the speech patterns of characters within this genre, particularly concerning first-person pronouns and sentence-ending particles, reveals how gendered language is represented and potentially conventionalized within this popular medium. Comparisons with standard Japanese usage and the linguistic styles found in shonen manga (comics targeting boys) further illuminate the specific features of shoujo manga's language.

A. Pronoun Patterns in Shoujo Manga Characters
Corpus-based linguistic analyses of popular shoujo manga series provide empirical data on pronoun usage by characters within the genre.10

Female Characters: The predominant first-person pronoun (1PP) used by female characters in the analyzed shoujo manga corpus was atashi (あたし), the informal feminine pronoun.10 The more formal or neutral watashi (私) was also used, but to a lesser extent.11 This pattern generally aligns with expectations for informal feminine speech in Japanese. A significant finding from these studies is the consistent absence of female characters using masculine 1PPs such as boku (僕) or ore (俺).10 Additionally, the informal feminine pronoun uchi (うち), while common in some real-world youth demographics 18, was also reported as absent in one major corpus analysis of popular manga.13
Male Characters: Male characters featured in shoujo manga predominantly employed the strongly masculine, informal 1PP ore (俺).10 The more neutral or formal watashi was used less frequently 11, and the moderately masculine boku also appeared.11 Instances of male characters using feminine 1PPs were extremely rare; one study noted only five instances of uchi across the entire male dialogue corpus 11, and another mentioned a single instance of atashi used by a character identified as a female-identifying transsexual.13
Second Person Pronouns (2PPs): Analysis also touched upon second-person pronouns. Male characters in the studied manga frequently used omae (お前), a familiar and often masculine 2PP.10 Female characters tended to use anta (あんた), an informal feminine equivalent of anata, or the more polite and neutral anata (あなた).10 While generally adhering to gender norms, some exceptions were noted: certain female characters, often older women or non-human characters, occasionally used the masculine omae.10 One striking example involved the character Nana (from the manga Nana), who frequently used the extremely rude masculine 2PP temee (てめえ) towards others, yet consistently referred to herself using the feminine 1PP atashi.10
Overall Pronoun Usage: The research consistently indicates that first-person pronoun usage within the analyzed popular shoujo manga corpus largely adheres to traditional, normative gender lines.11 Cross-gender pronoun usage, particularly females using masculine 1PPs, was virtually non-existent in these mainstream examples.
B. Sentence-Ending Particle Patterns in Shoujo Manga Characters
The use of sentence-ending particles (SFPs) in shoujo manga presents a more complex picture compared to pronouns.

Female Characters: Analysis of the shoujo manga corpus revealed that female characters predominantly used neutral (N) and moderately masculine (MM) SFPs.11 These two categories combined accounted for a significant majority (over 87%) of the SFPs uttered by female characters in the sample.11 Common MM forms like the plain copula da and the particle yo are increasingly considered neutral in contemporary youth speech.11 Furthermore, female characters used moderately feminine (MF) particles more frequently than strongly feminine (SF) particles (such as wa with rising intonation or kashira).3 The use of strongly masculine (SM) particles (like zo or ze) was the least frequent category for female characters.11 This pattern, with its emphasis on neutral and moderately masculine forms and lower frequency of strongly feminine forms, appears to reflect the broader trend of linguistic neutralization observed in the speech of young Japanese women in recent decades.3 Strongly feminine forms, when they did appear in shoujo manga, were often associated with specific contexts, such as characters intentionally emphasizing their femininity, characters from noble or older backgrounds, or in semi-formal interactions.3
Male Characters: Male characters in the analyzed shoujo manga also showed a preference for neutral (N) SFPs, followed by moderately masculine (MM) and then strongly masculine (SM) particles.11 Feminine particles (both MF and SF) were used least often by male characters.11 This pattern generally aligns with expectations for informal male speech.
C. Comparison with Shonen Manga and Standard Usage
Contrasting the linguistic features of shoujo manga with those found in shonen manga (comics targeting boys) highlights significant genre-based differences in the representation of gendered language.

Pronoun Comparison: A key difference lies in the 1PPs used by female characters. While shoujo manga female characters favored the informal feminine atashi, female characters in the analyzed shonen manga corpus predominantly used the more formal/neutral watashi.10 The use of atashi by female characters in shonen manga was comparatively rare.10 Male characters in both genres showed a strong preference for the masculine ore.10 This suggests that shonen manga tends to portray female characters using more reserved or formal self-reference compared to the informal femininity commonly depicted in shoujo manga. Importantly, both genres, in the popular titles analyzed, largely avoided depicting cross-gender 1PP usage.11
Particle Comparison: The SFP usage patterns also diverged significantly between the genres, particularly for female characters. In the shonen manga corpus, female characters used strongly feminine (SF) particles more frequently than moderately feminine (MF) ones.11 This is the inverse of the pattern found in shoujo manga, where MF particles were more common than SF ones.11 Although female characters in shonen manga still utilized neutral and MM particles frequently, the overall percentage was lower than in shoujo manga (approximately 69% N+MM in shonen vs. 87% N+MM in shoujo).11 This suggests that female speech in shonen manga is marked by more traditional or stereotypical feminine features compared to shoujo manga. Male characters across both genres exhibited similar overall SFP patterns (N > MM > SM > MF > SF), but there was some indication that strongly masculine (SM) forms might be somewhat overused in shonen manga, potentially reflecting a more stereotypical or heightened representation of masculine speech in that genre.11
Dialogue Balance: Shonen manga typically features a much higher proportion of dialogue spoken by male characters (around 80% in analyzed corpora), whereas shoujo manga tends to have a more balanced distribution between male and female character speech (around 55% female dialogue).10
Overall Linguistic Style: These comparisons suggest that shonen manga often presents a more linguistically conservative or stereotyped portrayal of gender.11 Female characters tend to use more formal self-reference (watashi) and more strongly marked feminine particles, while male characters might lean more heavily on strongly masculine particles. In contrast, the linguistic style of shoujo manga, particularly in the SFP usage of female characters, appears to align more closely with the neutralization trends observed in contemporary Japanese youth speech.3
Table 3: Comparative Linguistic Features in Shoujo vs. Shonen Manga 11

Linguistic Feature	Shoujo Manga (Typical Usage/Pattern)	Shonen Manga (Typical Usage/Pattern)
Female 1PP	atashi > watashi; No masculine 1PPs observed.	watashi >> atashi; No masculine 1PPs observed.
Male 1PP	ore dominant; boku, watashi less frequent; Feminine 1PPs very rare.	ore dominant; boku, watashi less frequent; Feminine 1PPs very rare.
Female SFPs	N / MM dominant (~87%); MF > SF; SM least frequent.	N / MM frequent (~69%); SF > MF; SM least frequent.
Male SFPs	N dominant; followed by MM, SM; MF/SF least frequent.	N dominant; followed by MM, SM (potentially overused); MF/SF least frequent.
Dialogue Share	More balanced (~55% Female)	Heavily skewed to Male (~80% Male)
The consistent finding that popular shoujo and shonen manga corpora lack instances of female characters using masculine first-person pronouns like boku or ore 10 presents a significant challenge to the frequently encountered assumption that manga serves as a direct model or primary cause for this real-world linguistic behavior observed among some young Japanese women.10 If the most widely consumed manga do not actually contain these linguistic patterns, then the source of this real-world usage must lie elsewhere – perhaps in older or less mainstream manga, influence from specific iconic characters not captured in the corpora, peer group dynamics, or other forms of identity expression independent of direct manga modeling. This discrepancy suggests that the perceived link between manga and female use of masculine pronouns may be overstated or based on flawed assumptions. The influence, if present, might operate more indirectly, perhaps through the broader thematic exploration of gender roles found in some manga 45, rather than direct linguistic imitation of popular characters.

Comparing the linguistic styles across genres reveals potentially different constructions of femininity. Shoujo manga's tendency to feature female characters using the informal atashi and a high proportion of neutral or moderately masculine SFPs 11 aligns more closely with observed trends in contemporary youth speech, where strongly feminine markers are less prevalent.3 Conversely, shonen manga's preference for the more formal watashi and a higher frequency of strongly feminine SFPs for its female characters 11 suggests a reliance on more traditional, perhaps stereotypical, linguistic markers of femininity. This could imply that shoujo manga offers linguistic models that feel more current or relatable to young readers, including queer youth, particularly regarding particle usage, even while maintaining normative pronoun patterns. Shonen manga, in contrast, might present a more artificial or historically rooted version of female speech.

The thematic focus inherent in each genre also likely shapes the linguistic environment presented to readers. Shoujo manga frequently centers on interpersonal relationships, romance, and emotional development.41 This narrative focus naturally necessitates more extensive dialogue exploring characters' internal states and interactions, contributing to the more balanced representation of male and female speech observed in corpora.13 The prevalence of school settings and relationship dramas encourages the use of informal language styles, including particles common in peer interactions. Shonen manga, often focusing on action, adventure, and conflict 49, may prioritize male protagonists and external plot progression, leading to the documented dominance of male character dialogue.43 Consequently, the very structure and thematic conventions of shoujo manga create a potentially richer source for observing informal, relational language, offering more exposure to varied (though still largely normative) gendered speech patterns in interaction compared to the male-dominated linguistic landscape of typical shonen manga.

III. Language and Identity Among Queer Young Adults in Japan
The Japanese language, with its nuanced system of gendered expressions, provides a rich set of resources that queer individuals can utilize to negotiate, perform, and express their gender and sexual identities.16 Linguistic choices, particularly involving first-person pronouns and sentence-ending particles, are not fixed but are dynamically employed depending on context, audience, desired self-presentation, and individual identity.16

A. Navigating Pronouns: Choices and Identity Negotiation
The selection of first-person pronouns is a particularly salient site for identity work among queer Japanese speakers. Research reveals a diversity of practices across different segments of the community:

Gay Men: Studies indicate that gay Japanese men exhibit considerable variation in their pronoun usage. While some comfortably use the standard masculine informal pronouns boku or ore in peer interactions, sometimes exclusively 36, others express a preference for the gender-neutral watashi or even the feminine atashi.52 This choice often stems from a feeling that masculine pronouns do not align with their personal identity.52 Lunsing & Maree (2004) noted that some gay men dislike the hypermasculine ore and, while using the less masculine boku, may prefer the neutrality of watashi.52 Pronoun choice can also be context-dependent; one participant in a study switched between boku in public/professional settings and atashi when discussing gay community topics, suggesting a linguistic demarcation between different facets of life.52 Furthermore, peer influence appears to play a role, with one individual reporting that his use of watashi was likely influenced by his conversation partner's use of feminine forms.52
Lesbian Women: Research on lesbian pronoun use presents a somewhat evolving picture. Hideko Abe's earlier fieldwork (documented in her 2010 book Queer Japanese) observed instances where lesbians might employ masculine pronouns like ore in specific situations (e.g., expressing anger) or use boku.16 However, a more recent analysis (2020) comparing Abe's findings to the speech in the documentary Queer Japan suggested that such overt masculine pronoun use by lesbians might be becoming less common or viewed as stereotypical, with standard feminine (atashi, watashi) or neutral forms potentially being more prevalent in contemporary usage.29 The gender-neutral pronoun jibun has also been noted as an option used by some lesbians or onabe individuals seeking to avoid explicitly gendered terms.1 The term onabe (おなべ), historically referring to masculine-presenting lesbians or female cross-dressers but now sometimes encompassing trans men, has been associated with varied pronoun choices, including jibun, ore, or boku, reflecting diverse identities within this category.1
Non-Binary / X-Gender Individuals: People identifying outside the traditional male/female binary, often using the term X-gender (Xジェンダー, ekkusu jendā) in Japan 53, frequently seek gender-neutral linguistic options. The pronoun watashi is a common choice due to its formal neutrality, and its increasing acceptance as neutral even in informal contexts, despite residual feminine connotations.24 Jibun (自分) is another significant option, valued for its inherent lack of gender association and sometimes used deliberately as a statement rejecting the gender binary.1 Some individuals may also prefer to be referred to by their name instead of any pronoun 56, or AFAB (assigned female at birth) non-binary individuals might use the masculine boku to express a non-feminine identity.24 For third-person reference, using the person's name or explicitly neutral terms like ano hito (あの人, 'that person') or ano kata (あの方, 'that person' - more polite) is common practice when gender is unknown or non-binary.56
Fluidity and Context: It is crucial to recognize that pronoun choice is rarely static, even for a single individual. A speaker might strategically deploy different pronouns depending on the social setting (e.g., work vs. friends), the relationship with the listener, and the specific communicative goal or emotion being expressed.16 For example, a queer woman who usually uses watashi might use ore in a moment of anger 16, or a gay man might use watashi formally but boku or ore casually.52
B. Particle Usage and Stylistic Variation (incl. onee kotoba)
Sentence-ending particles and broader stylistic choices also serve as resources for queer identity expression.

General Trends: Queer individuals, particularly younger generations, likely participate in the wider societal trend towards linguistic neutralization.24 This may involve favoring neutral SFPs like ne and yo, or moderately gendered particles that are becoming increasingly common in youth speech (like da yo or question no), over strongly marked feminine (wa, kashira) or masculine (zo, ze) options. The specific choices will vary based on individual identity, desired presentation, and social context.
Onee Kotoba (オネエ言葉, "Queen's Speech"): This is a highly recognizable, often stereotyped speech style associated primarily with effeminate gay men and some transgender women, particularly prominent in Japanese media and entertainment contexts.1 Linguistically, onee kotoba is typically characterized by an exaggerated use of features associated with traditional feminine speech, such as:
Feminine first-person pronouns (e.g., atashi).36
Frequent use of feminine sentence-ending particles (e.g., wa, wayo, kashira, no used emphatically).36
Use of polite verb forms (desu/masu) even in informal contexts.1
Higher pitch range.1
Use of feminine interjections (e.g., ara あら) and set phrases (e.g., iya, komatchau いや、困っちゃう - "Oh dear, how troublesome").51
A potential mixture with blunt, vulgar, or masculine language, or sudden shifts in pitch and style for comedic or dramatic effect.1 It is widely considered a performative style, often used in specific settings like gay bars or by television personalities (tarento) for entertainment purposes.29 Many sources emphasize that it is not representative of how most gay men speak in everyday life.29 While it can function as a marker of identity or community within certain groups, or as a tool for performance and humor 60, onee kotoba is also criticized by some within the queer community for reinforcing stereotypes, being potentially disrespectful to women, or being used by mainstream media to mock queer individuals.24 Some research suggests its origins may lie in the language practices of male sex workers (danshō) in the Shōwa era who adopted feminine styles.1 Some studies propose that the choice to use onee kotoba might stem from internal feelings of femininity, regardless of sexual orientation.60
Other Stylistic Choices: Beyond onee kotoba, queer individuals may make conscious choices about particle usage to construct their desired persona. This could involve deliberately avoiding strongly gendered particles in favor of neutral options to achieve a less marked style, or perhaps strategically using particles associated with the 'opposite' gender to challenge norms, although evidence for the latter seems less common in everyday speech compared to pronoun variation.24
C. Linguistic Practices as Queer Identity Expression
In a societal context where overt expressions of queerness can be met with misunderstanding, stigma, or pressure to conform 14, language becomes a crucial, albeit often subtle, tool for identity expression and community building.

Visibility and Invisibility: Linguistic choices offer ways to signal one's identity to those who understand the cues, while potentially remaining ambiguous to outsiders.14 This can be particularly important in navigating spaces where being openly queer might feel unsafe or undesirable.
Subverting Norms: The act of using linguistic forms that deviate from heteronormative expectations—such as an AFAB person using boku, an AMAB person using atashi informally, or anyone consistently using the neutral jibun—can be a powerful statement challenging the assumed link between biological sex and linguistic gender.16
Community Building: Shared linguistic resources, whether specific slang terms used within the community (known collectively as ゲイ用語, gei yōgo 58), preferred pronouns, or even styles like onee kotoba within specific subcultures or contexts, can foster a sense of shared identity and belonging.51 Online platforms have become particularly important venues for the development and maintenance of these linguistic communities.14
Negotiation and Strategy: Queer speakers are constantly engaged in a process of negotiation, balancing the desire for authentic self-expression through language with the need to navigate social expectations, potential prejudice, and the risk of being misunderstood.50 Opting for gender-neutral forms like watashi or jibun can represent a strategic choice, allowing individuals to express themselves without invoking strong gender associations or attracting unwanted attention.24
The wide spectrum of linguistic practices observed among queer individuals in Japan 16 underscores the fact that there is no single, uniform "queer Japanese language." Instead, queer speakers employ a diverse range of strategies, drawing upon and adapting the existing, evolving resources of the Japanese language to construct and perform their unique identities in various contexts. Highly visible styles like onee kotoba, often amplified by media, represent only one specific, often performative, facet of this linguistic diversity.29 Attributing specific linguistic features solely to "queer influence" oversimplifies the complex interplay between individual agency, community norms, and broader sociolinguistic trends.

A notable pattern emerging from research on queer pronoun use, particularly among non-binary individuals and some gay men or lesbians, is the gravitation towards neutral options like watashi and jibun.1 While the standard informal pronouns atashi and ore present a clear feminine/masculine binary, watashi offers formal neutrality that can be adapted, and jibun provides inherent neutrality. This preference suggests that for some queer speakers, the primary goal might be the avoidance of strongly gender-marked informal pronouns, rather than necessarily performing a cross-gender identity by adopting the pronoun associated with the 'opposite' binary gender. This strategy allows individuals to opt out of the informal atashi/ore dichotomy, potentially prioritizing gender neutrality or ambiguity over signaling a specific non-conforming gender identity through overtly cross-gendered language.

The significant attention given to onee kotoba, contrasted with its reported rejection or limited use by many gay men in everyday life 29, highlights a critical tension between media representation and lived reality. The style's prominence in entertainment media creates a powerful, widely recognized stereotype of gay male speech.1 However, this media portrayal may not accurately reflect the diverse linguistic practices within the community and can be viewed as problematic or limiting by members themselves.51 This discrepancy underscores the caution required when using media depictions as a proxy for understanding the actual language use of minority groups; media representations of queer language can be highly mediated, stereotyped, and may not reliably inform us about, let alone directly influence, authentic community practices.

IV. Shoujo Manga Consumption by Queer Youth
Understanding the potential influence of shoujo manga requires examining who reads it and why, particularly focusing on consumption patterns among queer young adults.

A. Readership Demographics and Subgenre Appeal (BL, Yuri)
Shoujo Manga Readership: The primary target demographic for shoujo manga is explicitly adolescent girls and young adult women.41 Manga magazines often signal this target audience through their titles or branding (e.g., Viz Media's "Shojo Beat" line 67). However, readership is acknowledged to be more fluid than these marketing categories suggest; boys, men, and older women also read shoujo manga.41 Conversely, genres traditionally targeting males, like shonen manga, have seen a significant increase in female readership, sometimes constituting half or more of the audience for popular titles.68
Boys' Love (BL) / Yaoi: This genre, depicting romantic and often erotic relationships between male characters (typically bishōnen, beautiful boys), originated as a subgenre within shoujo manga in the 1970s, largely concurrent with the rise of female manga artists dominating the field.49 BL/yaoi remains a highly popular genre, often shelved within or near the shoujo manga sections in Japanese bookstores.73 Despite depicting male same-sex relationships, the genre is overwhelmingly created by female artists and consumed primarily by a female, largely heterosexual, audience.49 Various terms are used within the genre (BL, yaoi, shonen-ai, June), sometimes referring to specific nuances (e.g., level of explicitness, age of characters) but often used interchangeably by fans.71 The market for BL/yaoi is substantial.71 While not the primary target audience, studies and anecdotal reports indicate that queer individuals, including gay men and lesbians, do consume BL manga and have sometimes cited it, along with other gender-bending manga from the era, as influential during their formative years.70
Yuri / Girls' Love (GL): This genre focuses on romantic and emotional relationships between female characters.67 Its origins can be traced to early 20th-century Japanese girls' literature (known as Class S fiction) and early manga pioneers like Nobuko Yoshiya and Osamu Tezuka's Princess Knight.69 Unlike BL/yaoi, the readership for yuri is considered more diverse, attracting a mix of male and female readers, as well as both straight and queer fans and creators.67 While perhaps not as commercially dominant as BL, yuri is a growing category.67 The term "GL" (Girls' Love) has also gained popularity in Japan as an equivalent.73
Queer Youth Consumption: Direct data quantifying the specific consumption rates of shoujo manga (distinct from BL/Yuri subgenres) by queer young adults in Japan is limited in the provided sources. However, the general popularity of manga and anime among Japanese youth 71, the existence of popular queer-themed subgenres like BL and Yuri often associated with or adjacent to shoujo 67, and reports of manga/anime serving as important media for LGBTQ+ youth lacking other resources 64 strongly suggest that queer young adults engage with shoujo manga and related genres. The fact that queer individuals form part of the BL/Yaoi audience, even if not the primary demographic, further supports this.71
B. Potential Motivations for Consumption (Representation, Escapism, Information)
Queer young adults may be drawn to shoujo manga and related genres for a variety of reasons:

Representation and Visibility: In a society where positive and realistic portrayals of LGBTQ+ individuals can be scarce in mainstream media or educational settings 64, manga and anime can offer crucial visibility.75 Works depicting same-sex relationships (BL, Yuri) or exploring gender non-conformity provide images of lives outside heteronormative structures.70 Some specific manga, like Wandering Son (exploring transgender identities) or Bokura no Hentai (featuring trans and cross-dressing youth), have been praised for offering more empathetic and nuanced portrayals.75 Even if not explicitly targeted at them, some queer readers find points of identification with characters or themes in BL manga.70
Information Seeking: Japanese youth often face a lack of accessible, accurate information about LGBTQ+ issues in schools or from official sources.64 School libraries may lack resources or contain outdated materials framing gender variance as a disorder.64 In this vacuum, media like manga can become an alternative source of information, however stylized, inaccurate, or fantasy-based it might be.75 Some non-fiction or educational manga specifically aim to raise awareness about LGBTQ+ topics.77
Escapism and Entertainment: Manga, like all popular media, provides entertainment and escapism.74 The specific appeal of genres like BL/Yaoi has been linked to factors beyond simple representation, including strong emotional engagement with characters and relationships, appreciation for intricate storylines, attraction to the distinctive art styles and aesthetics, the exploration of forbidden or transgressive love narratives, and sometimes a stated dislike for the perceived limitations or predictability of standard heterosexual romance tropes often found in mainstream shoujo manga (e.g., one-dimensional female characters).71 The fantasy settings common in BL and Yuri can allow for the exploration of relationships and identities freed from the constraints of real-world societal pressures.70
Community and Fandom: Engaging with specific manga or genres can connect individuals to larger fan communities, both online and offline.71 These communities provide spaces for discussion, sharing interpretations, and potentially finding others with similar interests or identities, which can be particularly valuable for members of minority groups.
The fact that the primary demographic for BL/Yaoi, the most prominent queer-themed genre associated with shoujo manga, consists mainly of heterosexual women 49 complicates simplistic assumptions about why queer youth might consume these works. While seeking self-representation is undoubtedly a factor for some queer readers 70, it cannot be assumed as the sole or even primary motivation. The genre's appeal clearly extends beyond direct identification, encompassing narrative preferences (complex relationships, emotional depth), aesthetic appreciation, and perhaps a desire to engage with romance narratives that sidestep traditional gender dynamics present in heterosexual shoujo stories.71 This suggests that any potential influence of these manga on queer readers' identities or language use might stem from a complex mix of factors, not just the mirroring of explicitly queer experiences.

Furthermore, the historical influence cited by some lesbians points towards early shoujo manga that explored gender ambiguity and intense emotional bonds, such as Princess Knight or The Rose of Versailles.69 These works were not necessarily BL or Yuri but featured androgynous protagonists or challenged traditional gender roles. The identification reported by some readers with these narratives suggests that shoujo manga's impact might lie significantly in its capacity to normalize gender fluidity, validate intense same-sex emotional connections (friendships, rivalries, mentorships), and explore identities beyond conventional boundaries, rather than solely providing explicit queer representation or specific linguistic models for queer speech.

The documented reliance of many Japanese youth on manga and anime for information about LGBTQ+ identities, due to shortcomings in formal education and accessible resources 64, creates a potentially problematic situation. Media portrayals, particularly in genres like BL/Yaoi or through comedic representations like onee kotoba, often employ stereotypes, fantasy elements, or exaggerated language (yakuwarigo).62 When these potentially non-realistic depictions become primary sources for understanding queerness (whether one's own identity or that of others), they could shape perceptions and potentially even linguistic practices in ways that diverge significantly from the lived realities and diverse experiences within the actual queer community. This highlights the critical need for accessible, accurate information and diverse, authentic representation beyond stylized media tropes.

V. Assessing the Influence of Shoujo Manga on Queer Language Use
Synthesizing the findings on standard Japanese gendered language, the linguistic characteristics of shoujo manga, the practices of queer young adults, and their media consumption patterns allows for an evaluation of the potential impact of shoujo manga on the pronoun and particle use of this demographic.

A. Synthesizing Linguistic Styles, Practices, and Consumption
Recap of Key Points: Contemporary standard Japanese exhibits clear gendered distinctions in informal pronouns and particles, although these norms are undergoing a process of neutralization, particularly among younger speakers. Corpus analyses of popular shoujo manga indicate that while first-person pronoun usage largely adheres to traditional gender norms (with atashi common for females, ore for males, and no observed female use of boku/ore), the use of sentence-ending particles by female characters reflects the broader neutralization trend (high use of N/MM particles, lower use of SF particles compared to shonen manga). Queer young adults in Japan demonstrate diverse linguistic strategies for identity expression, utilizing a range of pronouns (including neutral watashi and jibun, and sometimes non-normative choices) and particles, often varying by context and individual identity. Shoujo manga, including its queer-themed subgenres like BL and Yuri, is consumed by queer youth for reasons including representation, entertainment, and potentially information seeking.
Connecting Manga Styles and Queer Practices:
Pronouns: The most striking disconnect lies here. The analyzed popular shoujo manga corpus does not provide models of female characters using masculine 1PPs like boku or ore.10 Therefore, if queer AFAB individuals adopt these pronouns, direct imitation of popular shoujo manga characters is an unlikely explanation. Their usage more plausibly stems from other influences such as peer group norms, independent identity expression aimed at rejecting femininity or embracing masculinity/neutrality, or strategies to fill perceived gaps in the pronoun system.4 Conversely, shoujo manga does model standard feminine (atashi) and neutral/formal (watashi) pronoun usage for female characters, and standard masculine usage (ore, boku) for male characters. These patterns align with the choices of some queer individuals who use normative or neutral pronouns (e.g., non-binary individuals using watashi, gay men using ore or boku).24 In essence, shoujo manga primarily reinforces standard pronoun usage, offering little direct linguistic basis for the adoption of cross-gender pronouns.
Particles: The situation with SFPs is different. Shoujo manga's tendency to depict female characters using a high proportion of neutral (N) and moderately masculine (MM) particles, while using strongly feminine (SF) particles less frequently than in shonen manga 3, does resonate with the broader societal trend of SFP neutralization among young women.26 This linguistic style presented in shoujo manga could potentially align with or reinforce the preferences of queer youth seeking less overtly gender-marked language. It provides readily available media models of informal speech that avoids the most stereotypical feminine endings (wa, kashira), potentially making such neutralized styles feel more accessible or validated.
B. Evaluating Potential Correlation vs. Causation
While certain correlations exist between the linguistic features of shoujo manga and the language trends or practices involving queer youth (e.g., the alignment on particle neutralization), the available evidence does not support a direct causal link, particularly for pronoun usage.

Correlation, Not Causation: The alignment between shoujo manga's neutralized female SFP usage and real-world youth trends is suggestive, but it is more likely that the manga is reflecting the linguistic behavior of its target demographic (young women, among whom queer youth are included) rather than single-handedly causing this shift.11 Both the manga creators (often female themselves 41) and the readers are participants in the same evolving sociolinguistic environment.
Counter-Evidence on Pronouns: The lack of empirical evidence for female characters using masculine 1PPs in the analyzed popular manga corpora serves as strong counter-evidence against the claim that manga is the primary driver of this specific non-normative linguistic practice.11 If the phenomenon exists in reality 4, its origins likely lie outside direct imitation of these popular media texts.
Potential Indirect Influence: If shoujo manga does exert an influence, it is likely to be more indirect:
Normalization of Themes: By depicting diverse relationship configurations (including intense same-sex bonds in BL/Yuri) and characters who challenge traditional gender roles or exhibit gender ambiguity 45, shoujo manga might contribute to a cultural atmosphere where exploring non-normative identities feels more permissible or conceivable for readers.75
Providing Concepts and Vocabulary: Manga, particularly genres dealing with relationships and identity, might introduce readers to ways of thinking about or labeling experiences related to gender and sexuality, even if the portrayals are stylized or fantastical.3
Reflecting and Amplifying Peer Language: Manga artists and editors may consciously or unconsciously incorporate linguistic trends prevalent among young people into character dialogue. In this way, manga could act as a mirror, reflecting and potentially amplifying language patterns originating in peer interactions back to its readership.
C. Situating Manga within Broader Media Influence Theories
The question of shoujo manga's influence fits within larger debates about media effects on language and society.

Media Reflecting vs. Shaping Society: This enduring debate finds resonance here. Is manga a passive mirror reflecting societal norms and linguistic changes, or an active agent shaping them? The evidence regarding shoujo manga suggests a complex interplay, likely reflecting existing trends (particle neutralization) while potentially contributing indirectly to shifts in attitudes or concepts related to gender and relationships.3
The Role of Yakuwarigo (Role Language): A critical concept for understanding language in Japanese fiction, including manga and anime, is yakuwarigo (役割語) – stereotyped speech patterns associated with specific character archetypes (e.g., old man, samurai, princess, tough guy).2 This linguistic shorthand helps establish characters quickly but often relies on exaggeration and may not reflect authentic speech.2 Learners who acquire Japanese primarily through anime or manga risk adopting unnatural or inappropriate yakuwarigo.2 Queer characters, when depicted, may also be assigned specific yakuwarigo, such as the association of gay men with onee kotoba in many media portrayals.62 This means that the language queer youth encounter in manga might be a constructed stereotype rather than a model of genuine queer speech.
Limitations of Media Influence on Core Language: Traditional sociolinguistic research often posits that mass media, particularly non-interactive forms like print or broadcast, has a limited impact on core aspects of language structure, such as phonology or grammar, compared to the influence of face-to-face interaction within social networks.6 Change is thought to diffuse primarily through personal contact. While media might influence vocabulary, catchphrases, or discourse styles, its power to alter fundamental grammatical choices like pronoun systems is often considered weaker. However, the rise of interactive social media, where users actively produce and negotiate language, may be altering this dynamic.6
Media and Minority Representation: Regardless of direct linguistic impact, media plays an undeniable role in the representation and visibility of minority groups, including linguistic minorities and LGBTQ+ communities.80 Portrayals in popular media like manga can significantly shape public perceptions, influence societal attitudes, and impact the self-understanding of minority individuals.75 Whether these portrayals are positive, negative, stereotypical, or nuanced has real-world consequences.
Considering the evidence, the most plausible linguistic influence of shoujo manga on queer young adults appears to lie in the domain of sentence-ending particles rather than first-person pronouns. The frequent modeling of neutralized feminine speech (high N/MM particle use by female characters) aligns with broader sociolinguistic trends among Japanese youth and offers readily accessible media examples of this less overtly gender-marked style. This could subtly reinforce or validate the adoption of similar patterns by queer youth seeking less marked forms of expression. The influence is likely reinforcing of existing tendencies rather than initiating them, focusing on a grammatical category (particles) where manga style converges with real-world shifts, unlike the divergence observed in pronoun usage.

The persistent discrepancy between the popular perception that manga drives female use of masculine pronouns and the lack of supporting evidence in analyses of widely read manga 10 warrants closer examination. This gap might indicate a form of "folk linguistics" or even a "moral panic," where a popular youth medium like manga becomes an easy scapegoat for societal anxieties surrounding perceived transgressions of traditional gender roles and language norms.12 When young women adopt language seen as "masculine," attributing it to media influence might be simpler than engaging with the complex underlying social and identity factors driving such choices. This underscores the need to critically evaluate claims about media's linguistic impact, separating empirical findings from potentially biased popular narratives.

Finally, the concept of yakuwarigo 2 serves as a crucial reminder that language in manga is often constructed for narrative effect, relying on stereotypes. Even when shoujo manga features queer characters or themes, their speech patterns might be highly stylized representations of queerness (like the onee kotoba stereotype 62) designed to signal a character type to the audience, rather than authentic reflections for queer readers to emulate. Consequently, the primary influence of manga on queer youth's understanding of language might be in shaping their perceptions of how different identities are "supposed" to sound (potentially reinforcing stereotypes), rather than directly influencing their own authentic linguistic production.

VI. Beyond Manga: Other Factors Shaping Queer Linguistic Practices
While shoujo manga may play a role in the complex ecosystem of influences on language use, it is crucial to consider other significant factors that shape the linguistic practices of queer young adults in Japan. These include peer interactions, online communities, other forms of media, and broader sociolinguistic trends.

A. The Role of Peer Interaction and Community Norms
Sociolinguistic research consistently highlights the paramount importance of peer-to-peer, face-to-face interaction in language acquisition, variation, and change.7 Young people's linguistic styles are heavily shaped by the norms and practices of their immediate social networks. For queer young adults, specific linguistic features or styles may emerge and become conventionalized within their own communities – be they friendship circles, school clubs, social groups, or patrons of specific venues like gay bars.14 Studies on gay men's pronoun use, for instance, explicitly noted the potential influence of conversation partners on pronoun choice.52 Shared slang (like gei yōgo 58) or interactional styles can serve to build solidarity and reinforce group identity. In environments where expressing queer identity openly carries social risks, such as schools where bullying can occur or families where acceptance is uncertain 15, supportive peer groups become vital spaces for developing, practicing, and validating identity-affirming language.

B. The Impact of Online Spaces and Digital Communication
The internet and social media have become profoundly important spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals in Japan, offering platforms for connection, information sharing, community building, and identity negotiation that can transcend geographical limitations or offline social constraints.14 Platforms mentioned in relation to queer communities include Facebook groups (e.g., Stonewall Japan), specialized dating/social apps (e.g., 9monsters), online forums (historically, Ameba, Mixi), and general social media.54 These digital environments are known to foster linguistic creativity and the rapid spread of new terms, slang, and communication styles.6 Online interactions shape how users present themselves linguistically and construct their identities.8 It is highly likely that queer-specific terminology (including Japanese adaptations of English terms like gei, rezubian, toransujendā, or community-specific slang) circulates, evolves, and is negotiated within these online spaces.58 Online advice columns and forums continue the function previously served by print magazines, providing spaces for queer individuals to discuss etiquette, seek advice, and construct shared understandings.14 The relative anonymity afforded by some online platforms may also provide safer spaces for experimenting with language and identity expression compared to offline interactions.

C. Influence of Other Media Forms (Anime, TV, Music)
Beyond manga, other media forms contribute to the linguistic environment:

Anime: Often adapting manga storylines, anime utilizes similar linguistic conventions, including gendered language and yakuwarigo.2 Like manga, it can serve as a source of representation or information for queer youth.75 However, the reliance on stereotyped role language means that learning Japanese solely from anime can lead to unnatural or socially inappropriate speech patterns.2
Television: Japanese television, particularly variety shows, has played a significant role in popularizing the onee kotoba speech style through the frequent appearance of onee tarento (flamboyant entertainers who may identify as gay or transgender).1 While increasing visibility, these portrayals often rely on comedic stereotypes and may not reflect the diversity of queer experiences or language use.62 More recently, television dramas featuring queer characters and storylines have emerged, sometimes offering more nuanced depictions and potentially challenging stereotypes.50
Music: The use of the masculine pronoun boku by female singers in Japanese idol group songs (e.g., Perfume, AKB48) provides another example of non-normative pronoun use in popular media.24 This practice is often interpreted not as a reflection of the singers' personal identities, but as a lyrical strategy to create a more neutral or relatable persona for love songs, appealing to both male and female listeners, or simply for metrical convenience.24 Nonetheless, it exposes listeners to instances where gendered pronoun norms are transgressed in a mainstream context.
D. Broader Sociolinguistic Trends
The language use of queer young adults is inevitably embedded within larger sociolinguistic currents affecting Japanese society as a whole.

Language Neutralization: As previously discussed (Section I.B, Section V.A), the ongoing trend towards less overtly gender-marked language, particularly the decline in strongly feminine particle usage among younger women, is a significant factor.24 Queer individuals are participants in this broader shift, and their adoption of neutral forms may be influenced by this general trend as much as by specific identity motivations.
Institutional Push for Neutrality: Conscious efforts by institutions like schools and universities to promote gender neutrality – for example, by discouraging the use of gendered honorifics like -kun for boys and -chan for girls in favor of the neutral -san 24 – contribute to raising awareness and potentially encouraging the use of more neutral language forms across the board. Growing public discourse surrounding LGBTQ+ rights and diversity initiatives may also foster a climate more receptive to gender-neutral language.76
Influence of English and Globalization: The influx of English loanwords related to gender and sexuality (e.g., ジェンダー jendā, ゲイ gei, レズビアン rezubian, トランスジェンダー toransujendā, ノンバイナリー nonbainarī, クィア kuia) provides new terminological resources for discussing these identities.50 While these terms are adopted, their specific meanings and connotations can be reshaped within the Japanese cultural and linguistic context.73 This borrowing process actively shapes how gender and sexuality are conceptualized and discussed.
Considering these multiple factors, online communities likely represent a more potent and direct influence on the contemporary linguistic innovations and shared norms of queer young adults in Japan than static media like manga. The interactive nature of online platforms allows for real-time negotiation of identity, rapid dissemination of slang and styles, and the formation of linguistic communities validated by peer interaction.8 While manga might offer initial exposure to certain themes or representations, the dynamic evolution and practice of queer linguistic styles are arguably more actively shaped within these online peer networks.

The convergence of the broader societal trend towards language neutralization among youth 24 and the desire among some queer individuals for less gender-marked forms of expression 24 creates a complex situation. Adopting neutral linguistic features (like neutral SFPs or pronouns such as watashi or jibun) may be becoming increasingly normalized for all young people. This could make it easier for queer youth to utilize such forms for identity expression without necessarily marking themselves as conspicuously "queer" or "non-normative" in the eyes of their peers. Their linguistic choices might thus be driven by a combination of identity-specific needs and participation in a general generational linguistic shift, making it challenging to isolate a single influencing factor like manga consumption.

Finally, the pervasive use of stereotyped yakuwarigo for queer characters in mainstream Japanese media, including manga, anime, and television 2, poses a potential obstacle. By frequently associating queer identities (particularly gay men via onee kotoba) with specific, often exaggerated or comedic, speech styles 62, media may inadvertently limit the public understanding of the true diversity of queer linguistic expression. This can create social pressure for real individuals to either conform to or actively distance themselves from these stereotypes 51, potentially hindering the development and acceptance of more varied and authentic ways of speaking within and outside the queer community. Media, therefore, might be more influential in shaping stereotypical perceptions about queer language than in directly modeling or influencing authentic usage.

VII. Conclusion and Future Directions
A. Summary of Findings on the Manga-Language Link
This investigation into the potential influence of shoujo manga consumption on the use of first-person pronouns and sentence-ending particles among queer young adults in Japan reveals a complex relationship, mediated by broader sociolinguistic trends and multiple influencing factors. The analysis of available research suggests the following key conclusions:

Limited Direct Influence on Pronoun Choice: Despite common assumptions linking manga to non-normative pronoun use (particularly female use of masculine 1PPs like boku or ore), linguistic corpus analyses of popular shoujo and shonen manga show a consistent lack of such cross-gender pronoun usage by female characters.10 Therefore, direct imitation of popular shoujo manga is an unlikely primary source for this specific linguistic behavior among queer (or straight) young women. Manga largely reinforces normative gendered pronoun use (atashi/watashi for females, ore/boku for males).
Plausible Reinforcing Influence on Particle Use: Shoujo manga's tendency to depict female characters using a high proportion of neutral and moderately masculine sentence-ending particles, while downplaying strongly feminine ones 3, aligns with observed real-world trends of linguistic neutralization among young Japanese women.26 While not definitively causal, this alignment suggests shoujo manga might reflect and potentially reinforce the adoption of less overtly gender-marked particle usage among its readership, including queer youth who may seek such forms for identity expression.
Manga as One Factor Among Many: Shoujo manga exists within a larger ecosystem of influences. Peer interaction, online communities, other media forms (anime, TV, music), and overarching societal shifts towards language neutralization all play significant roles in shaping the linguistic practices of queer young adults.24 Manga's influence is likely intertwined with these factors, potentially operating more indirectly through thematic normalization or concept provision rather than direct linguistic modeling.
Representation vs. Reality (Yakuwarigo): Language in manga often employs yakuwarigo (role language), utilizing stereotypes to define characters.2 Portrayals of queer characters and their speech (e.g., onee kotoba) may rely on such stereotypes, offering potentially misleading models of real-world queer language diversity.62
In summary, while shoujo manga is consumed by queer youth and offers representations that may resonate or inform, the evidence points away from it being a direct driver of non-normative pronoun choices. Its potential linguistic impact seems more plausible concerning sentence-ending particles, where its style aligns with broader youth language trends towards neutralization.

B. Highlighting Nuances and Complexities
It is essential to acknowledge the nuances inherent in this topic. Firstly, the queer community in Japan is diverse, and linguistic practices vary significantly based on individual identity (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, non-binary/X-gender, etc.), age, social context, peer group, and personal preference.29 There is no single "queer language" but rather a multitude of strategies for navigating a gendered linguistic system. Secondly, the available research has limitations. Corpus analyses are often based on a specific selection of popular manga titles and may not capture the full range of linguistic variation across the medium. Furthermore, direct ethnographic research specifically linking the media consumption habits of queer young adults to their detailed linguistic practices is scarce in the reviewed materials. Finally, the distinction between media representation – often mediated by genre conventions and stereotypes like yakuwarigo – and the authentic, fluid language use of individuals in real life must be maintained.

C. Recommendations for Further Research
To gain a deeper and more definitive understanding of the relationship between shoujo manga, language, and queer identity in Japan, further research is warranted in several areas:

Ethnographic and Interview-Based Studies: Research involving direct observation and in-depth interviews with queer young adults in Japan is crucial. Such studies should explore their self-perceived language use, identity expression strategies, attitudes towards gendered language, and explicitly inquire about their consumption of shoujo manga (and other media) and its perceived influence on their linguistic choices and identity formation.
Expanded Manga Corpus Analysis: Linguistic analysis should be extended to a broader range of manga, including less mainstream shoujo titles, specific BL and Yuri works often consumed by queer audiences, and potentially older manga series cited as influential, to determine if linguistic patterns differ significantly from those found in the popular corpora studied thus far. Comparing linguistic styles across different subgenres and publication eras would be valuable.
Analysis of Online Queer Communities: Given the importance of online spaces, detailed sociolinguistic analysis of language use within Japanese queer digital communities (forums, social media groups, apps) is needed. This could reveal contemporary linguistic trends, community-specific norms, and how identity is negotiated in these interactive environments.
Longitudinal Research: Studies tracking the language use and media consumption habits of individuals over time could provide stronger evidence regarding potential influence and developmental trajectories.
Focus on Intersectionality: Future research should consider how factors beyond gender and sexuality – such as regional background (dialect use), socioeconomic status, educational level, and specific subcultural affiliations – intersect to shape the linguistic practices and media engagement of queer young adults in Japan.
By pursuing these research avenues, a more nuanced and empirically grounded understanding can be achieved regarding the complex interplay between popular media like shoujo manga, the evolving nature of Japanese gendered language, and the diverse ways in which queer young adults in Japan use language to express their identities.
