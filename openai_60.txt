Situational Awareness of Cislunar Space Targets – Technical Analysis Report
Introduction
Cislunar space refers to the vast region between Earth and the Moon, encompassing Earth orbits beyond geosynchronous altitude (35,000 km) all the way to the Moon’s orbit (380,000 km from Earth) and including the Earth–Moon Lagrange points ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=Cislunar is the space below,resources and manufacturing in space)) (). Once a relatively empty domain, this region is rapidly becoming an active and strategically significant arena for space operations. A combination of technological advances (miniaturized electronics, cheaper launches) and renewed interest in lunar exploration and exploitation is driving an expansion of civil and commercial missions, as well as heightened military focus on cislunar space ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=More and more space activities,landscape%2C lest perceptions become distorted)). Over 100 lunar missions are expected in the next decade, surpassing the intensity of the 1960s Space Race ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=Space industry consultants Quilty Analytics,artificial objects in the region)). In fact, projections estimate 400+ spacecraft operating in cislunar space over the coming decade, including crewed vehicles, satellites, landers, and a growing volume of spent rocket stages and other debris ([AI-Enabled Cislunar Space Situational Awareness | KeAi Publishing](https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/space-habitation/call-for-papers/ai-enabled-cislunar-space-situational-awareness/#:~:text=Cislunar space%2C the region between,space traffic patterns%2C necessitate advanced)).

This surge of activity brings tremendous opportunities but also new challenges for situational awareness – the ability to detect, track, identify, and catalog objects and activities in space. Effective cislunar Space Situational Awareness (SSA) or Space Domain Awareness (SDA) is essential for collision avoidance, mission safety, and security of critical assets ([AI-Enabled Cislunar Space Situational Awareness | KeAi Publishing](https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/space-habitation/call-for-papers/ai-enabled-cislunar-space-situational-awareness/#:~:text=exploration%2C commercial activities%2C and national,tracking%2C and predictive modeling solutions)). However, today’s SSA frameworks and sensor networks have been primarily designed for the near-Earth environment, and they struggle to extend into cislunar space ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=This event was notable for,the associated Registration Convention only)). The unique characteristics of cislunar space – complex multi-body orbital dynamics, vast distances, intermittent illumination, and lack of established traffic management protocols – mean that simply scaling up existing techniques will not suffice () ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=This

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of conducting situational awareness for cislunar space targets, with a focus on supporting short-term tracking and monitoring tasks (e.g. rapid detection of new objects or maneuvers). We examine civil, military, and dual-use applications; identify key national and commercial players; assess current tracking capabilities and challenges; survey emerging technological solutions (optical, radar, AI/ML, space-based sensors); discuss policy frameworks and international coordination; and outline future trends, strategic considerations, and recommendations. The goal is to illuminate how the global space community can achieve robust cislunar situational awareness to ensure the safe, sustainable, and peaceful use of the Earth–Moon system.

Applications and Significance (Civil, Military, Dual-Use)
Civil Applications: Cislunar situational awareness has critical civil uses centered on spaceflight safety, scientific exploration, and navigation support. With agencies like NASA leading programs to return humans to the Moon (the Artemis program) and to deploy assets such as the Lunar Gateway station, knowing the whereabouts of all nearby objects is vital. Collision avoidance is a top concern – for instance, untracked debris or derelict spacecraft in lunar orbit could threaten crewed vehicles or sensitive instruments. Monitoring the cislunar environment also supports scientific missions (like lunar orbiters, landers, and telescopes) by providing data on potential hazards (such as meteoroids or space debris) and by enabling precise tracking for navigation and timing. Civil SSA in cislunar space thus underpins transparent and sustainable exploration, helping space agencies coordinate increasingly crowded lunar approaches and orbits () ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=This event was notable for,the associated Registration Convention only)). For example, NASA’s Artemis I mission alone released a dozen pieces of hardware (the Orion vehicle, its service module, an upper stage, and 10 cubesats), instantly populating cislunar space with many new objects that needed tracking ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=“If you just think about,”)). Future lunar operations will involve infrastructure like communications relays and navigation satellites (e.g. ESA’s planned Moonlight constellation) which will themselves provide and rely on SSA data to support surface landings, rendezvous, and surface activities.

Military Applications: From a security perspective, cislunar space is seen as the next strategic high ground. National defense organizations are expanding their mandate to monitor, track, and understand activities around the Moon in order to protect national interests (). The U.S. Space Force and U.S. Space Command, for instance, consider cislunar monitoring part of their remit, given that potential adversaries could position military assets or interfere with critical civil infrastructure in this region (). Military space domain awareness in cislunar space enables detection of unannounced spacecraft, attribution of potentially hostile actions, and general warning of strategic surprises. For example, an adversary could conceivably station a surveillance satellite at an Earth–Moon Lagrange point or in lunar orbit to observe terrestrial targets or intercept communications – early detection of such threats would rely on advanced cislunar tracking. The dual-use nature of many space technologies means that even ostensibly scientific missions can have military significance; thus defense planners seek comprehensive knowledge of all objects in cislunar space. Notably, renewed geopolitical rivalry is a driver for cislunar investment ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=factors%2C including the miniaturization of,increasing the risk of conflict)). Both the United States and China (among others) view a presence in cislunar space as strategically important, motivating efforts to “win” the next space race and avoid being caught off-guard. As a result, military planners are investing in sensors and satellites to extend surveillance to lunar distances and beyond.

Dual-Use and Commercial Applications: Many aspects of cislunar situational awareness are inherently dual-use. Commercial space companies play growing roles in this domain, both as operators of missions that need tracking and as providers of SSA services or data. On the commercial side, cislunar SSA supports emerging businesses in lunar resource extraction, tourism, and infrastructure. For instance, evidence of water ice in the Moon’s south polar craters has attracted companies interested in mining it for propellant and life support; these companies will require orbital information for their prospecting orbiters and landers (). Manufacturing and assembly in space (using lunar materials) is another potential use case, which would involve multiple craft operating near the Moon that must be monitored to prevent accidents ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=about 22%2C000 miles ,resources and manufacturing in space)). At the same time, private companies are contributing to situational awareness capabilities. Some have global networks of telescopes or radars originally aimed at satellites around Earth, now being tasked to search deeper into space. Others are developing software and AI algorithms to fuse sensor data and maintain catalogs of objects. Because space is inherently dual-use, data collected for civil safety can also inform military intelligence, and vice versa. For example, NASA’s tracking of its own lunar missions (using the Deep Space Network’s radio telemetry) produces trajectory data that could be shared for broader SSA purposes; similarly, a Space Force surveillance craft might relay information that helps civil operators avoid collisions (). Transparency and data-sharing between civil and military stakeholders is thus a key theme – ensuring that situational awareness serves both the protection of national security assets and the safety of international and commercial activities.

In summary, robust cislunar situational awareness underpins all uses of the Earth–Moon space: it enables civil exploration and commerce (through safety and coordination), while also guarding against potential misuse of this domain for military advantage. Table 1 below highlights some major actors and their interests in cislunar space, illustrating the blend of civil, military, and dual-use involvement.

As Table 1 suggests, cislunar space activity involves a mix of civil and military endeavors, often with overlapping technologies and goals. This blend reinforces the need for a holistic situational awareness approach that can serve multiple purposes. In the following sections, we delve into current capabilities and gaps in tracking cislunar objects, as well as the innovations aimed at filling those gaps.

Current Capabilities and Challenges in Cislunar Tracking
Existing Tracking Capabilities
Until recently, only a few organizations had reason to track objects in cislunar space – primarily those launching missions there. Accordingly, today’s tracking capabilities beyond GEO are limited and ad-hoc, built on extensions of near-Earth surveillance systems and deep-space mission tracking assets:

Ground-Based Optical Telescopes: Ground telescopes are a primary tool for SSA at high altitudes. The U.S. Space Surveillance Network (SSN) includes dedicated telescopes like the GEODSS system and the newly relocated Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) in Australia, which can scan for objects in GEO and even somewhat beyond. Commercial telescope networks (e.g. ExoAnalytic Solutions’ global optical sensor network) also contribute deep-space observations. These optical systems can detect satellites and debris by reflected sunlight. However, at cislunar distances, only larger or very sensitive telescopes can see small objects – a 1-meter object at lunar range is extremely dim. Moreover, optical tracking is constrained by lighting and line-of-sight: a telescope cannot see an object in Earth’s shadow (eclipse) or if the object is obscured by the Moon or too close to the Sun’s glare ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=As a passive radio frequency,the perspective of the observer)). Currently, no optical survey telescope continuously scans the entire cislunar volume, but some are sporadically tasked for specific objects or research. For example, when a mysterious rocket body was on course to hit the Moon in 2022, astronomers used ground telescopes to track it for weeks and predict the impact ([Rocket that slammed into the moon last year ID'ed as Chinese vehicle | Space](https://www.space.com/moon-crash-march-2022-china-rocket-body#:~:text=On March 4%2C 2022%2C a,slam into the lunar surface)). Some national observatories (like China’s Purple Mountain Observatory and others) occasionally search beyond GEO, mainly as part of asteroid searches (). Overall, ground optical coverage of cislunar space is patchy – excellent for known objects in favorable geometry, but not a comprehensive solution for discovering unknown targets.
Ground-Based Radars: Powerful radars can track objects at great distances by bouncing signals off them. The U.S. has experimented with using planetary radar systems (like NASA’s Goldstone 70m dish or the now-defunct Arecibo radar) to detect spacecraft near the Moon. In principle, radar can provide ranges and velocities very accurately. For instance, NASA’s Goldstone radar has successfully detected lunar orbiters and even mapped some Apollo relics on the Moon’s surface. There are also commercial deep-space radars coming online – the company COMSPOC (Commercial Space Operations Center) maintains “the world’s first commercial deep space radar tracking system” for SSA (). This likely refers to specialized phased-array radars capable of detecting objects at GEO and beyond. Still, radar range and sensitivity drop with distance; tracking a small object 400,000 km away requires tremendous power and large antennas. Thus, radar coverage of cislunar space is currently very limited and targeted (mostly used to track cooperative targets or perform research on known trajectories). A promising development is the repurposing of planetary defense radars – as nations build systems to detect near-Earth asteroids (for example, the U.S. and China both have plans for asteroid monitoring networks), those sensors could double as cislunar object scanners (). For now, ground radar is a valuable tool for precise tracking when an object’s orbit is roughly known, but not a wide-area search tool for cislunar space.
Space-Based Sensors (Current): At present, there are no dedicated space-based SSA satellites in cislunar space – nearly all surveillance assets are on Earth or in Earth orbit. However, a few existing spacecraft carry sensors that can aid situational awareness as a secondary function. Notably, the U.S. GSSAP satellites (Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program) reside near GEO and inspect satellites there; conceivably, they could be used to observe objects leaving GEO toward the Moon, but their range beyond GEO is limited. NASA’s lunar orbiter missions (such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, LRO) are not designed for tracking other objects, though LRO did photograph the fresh impact crater of the 2022 rocket collision on the Moon’s far side, confirming that event ([Rocket that slammed into the moon last year ID'ed as Chinese vehicle | Space](https://www.space.com/moon-crash-march-2022-china-rocket-body#:~:text=On March 4%2C 2022%2C a,slam into the lunar surface)). In a different vein, the Deep Space Network (DSN) – an array of large radio antennas (in California, Spain, Australia) – provides two-way communication and tracking of active spacecraft on lunar and interplanetary missions. The DSN’s tracking (through radio ranging, Doppler, and interferometry) yields very accurate trajectories for cooperating missions, like Artemis or Chang’e probes. Those data could contribute to SSA (and indeed are typically shared in public mission updates). However, the DSN and similar networks (ESA’s ESTRACK, China’s deep-space stations) won’t detect an uncooperative or passive object unless it broadcasts a signal. One notable technique is passive radio astronomy methods – for example, researchers at Johns Hopkins APL demonstrated using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) with radio antennas to track a known spacecraft via its radio emissions ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=This summer%2C Erin Fowler%2C an,track spacecraft in cislunar space)) ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=VLBI comes with limitations%2C however,time it emits a signal)). By correlating signals at multiple antennas, they achieved highly precise tracking and showed that adding even one space-based radio telescope in lunar orbit could dramatically improve resolution ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=Fowler’s team conducted a simulation,exciting improvement in tracking ability)). This underscores that novel uses of current assets (radio telescopes, etc.) are being tested to extend our tracking capabilities.
Human Observers and Ad-hoc Networks: In the absence of a formal system, much of our situational awareness in cislunar space has come from amateur astronomers and volunteer networks. A small community of skilled observers and hobbyists worldwide point their telescopes at high orbits and beyond, often catching unusual events. For example, when China’s Chang’e 5-T1 booster was quietly repositioned to a different orbit in 2021, it went largely unnoticed by official channels; it was amateur satellite-watchers who first noted the maneuver and spread the information ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=Lagrange point near the moon,using equipment in their backyards)) ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=not been a pressing need,country has ever proactively undertaken)). This informal contribution, while valuable, is not a substitute for systematic monitoring. It does, however, illustrate that many eyes (even amateur ones) can augment SSA coverage, and that currently no single authority has complete knowledge of cislunar space – it’s a patchwork of data from government sensors, commercial sensors, mission tracking, and amateur observations.
In summary, current capabilities can track known active spacecraft in cislunar space reasonably well, thanks to onboard transponders and networks like DSN. But the ability to discover and maintain custody of uncooperative or new objects is rudimentary. Existing SSA assets beyond GEO are limited in coverage – most sensors focus on the near-Earth region up to GEO (). The U.S. Space Force’s 18th and 19th Space Defense Squadrons have begun to incorporate data for “xGEO” (extra-GEO) or cislunar objects using the Space Surveillance Network and commercial inputs (), but this is an evolving effort. Notably, the 19th SDS (at Dahlgren, VA) is explicitly tasked with expanding awareness to lunar distances, leveraging anything from upgraded telescopes to partnerships with companies (). Commercial SSA providers like COMSPOC and others are likewise extending their catalog services beyond GEO, integrating data from new high-altitude sensors (). These are important first steps, yet the coverage is far from continuous or complete.

Key Challenges in Cislunar Tracking
Achieving effective situational awareness in cislunar space presents multiple technical and organizational challenges that go beyond those of traditional orbital tracking:

Distance and Diminished Signals: The vast distances involved (10× farther than GEO) mean that objects are much fainter to optical sensors and weaker to radar. A sensor’s detection ability scales with distance; for instance, an optical telescope that can detect a defunct satellite at 36,000 km might struggle to see a similar sized object at 380,000 km without longer exposures or larger aperture. Small debris (centimeter-scale) is essentially undetectable at lunar ranges with current technology, raising concerns about unseen hazards for spacecraft. Even active satellites emit signals that attenuate over distance – a low-power cubesat transmitter might be hard to pick up at lunar distance without large antennas. This “tyranny of distance” demands more sensitive sensors and possibly space-based detectors closer to the action (to shorten the range). It also means that maintaining custody of a newly discovered cislunar object is difficult – if you lose track for a few days, reacquisition is like finding a needle in a haystack. As an example, in March 2022 a rogue object (WE0913A) slammed into the Moon; it was tracked en route by telescopes, but identifying it conclusively took months of analysis, including spectral examination to distinguish its paint and trajectory – it was eventually confirmed to be a 2014 Chinese rocket stage ([Rocket that slammed into the moon last year ID'ed as Chinese vehicle | Space](https://www.space.com/moon-crash-march-2022-china-rocket-body#:~:text=The mystery involved the identity,the moon in October 2014)) ([Rocket that slammed into the moon last year ID'ed as Chinese vehicle | Space](https://www.space.com/moon-crash-march-2022-china-rocket-body#:~:text=One of the teams that,to the point of confirmation)). The lengthy identification process highlights how challenging it is to get detailed information on distant objects.
Complex Orbital Dynamics: Unlike the stable, closed orbits around Earth dominated by Earth’s gravity, cislunar trajectories exist in a four-body environment (Earth, Moon, Sun, spacecraft) and often follow non-Keplerian paths. Objects in cislunar space may be in halo orbits around Lagrange points, distant retrograde orbits, lunar orbits, or free-return loops – these are not simple ellipses. The standard two-body orbit models (and the prevalent TLE data format used for Earth satellites) do not hold for cislunar objects () (). Even a slight perturbation (e.g. an unmodeled gravity tug or maneuver) can cause large deviations. Current SSA systems risk losing “custody” of objects if they apply Earth-centric tracking approaches in cislunar space (). Accurate tracking requires high-fidelity modeling of the three-body dynamics (Earth-Moon-spacecraft) and sometimes even solar perturbations. This necessitates new orbit determination techniques and propagation tools. NASA’s SPICE ephemeris format (used for deep-space missions) is one solution recommended for cislunar tracking instead of TLEs () (), as it can handle complex trajectories. The paradigm shift is that ephemerides may need to be centrally maintained and shared, rather than every user generating orbits from simplified models () (). In short, the mathematics of keeping track of cislunar objects is more complex, and our software and algorithms need upgrades to avoid large errors.
Gaps in Sensor Coverage: There are significant “blind spots” in our ability to watch cislunar space. Ground sensors cannot see objects on the far side of the Moon, creating a literal blind zone where activities could go unobserved. An object in a lunar orbit can spend half its period out of sight of Earth-based trackers. Additionally, when objects are near the Sun from Earth’s perspective (e.g. at certain Lagrange point alignments), optical sensors are blinded. No single sensor modality can see everything all the time ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=As a passive radio frequency,the perspective of the observer)). We have few, if any, sensors positioned in cislunar space itself (like satellites at Lagrange points that could peek behind the Moon). Until space-based coverage improves, certain maneuvers or deployments could potentially be hidden from immediate detection. For example, a nation could place a small satellite in a low lunar orbit on the far side; unless another spacecraft is nearby or it eventually emerges, we might only detect it long after launch via indirect means. This lack of omnipresent coverage complicates short-term tracking tasks, since an object may only be observable during certain intervals (e.g., when it comes around the Moon or out of eclipse). It demands predictive orbit models to hand off targets between sensors and international cooperation to get eyes in different positions.
Short Tracking Arcs & Custody Transfer: When a new object is detected heading into cislunar space (such as a just-launched lunar mission or an unknown piece of debris on a lunar flyby trajectory), tracking often begins with a very short observation arc. Extrapolating an accurate orbit from limited data is tricky under the Moon’s influence. There’s a risk of losing track if follow-up observations aren’t timely. Short-term monitoring tasks – like tracking a transient object for days or weeks – require rapid cueing of multiple sensors and robust data fusion. The case of the Moon-bound rocket in 2022 is instructive: telescopes had to be quickly repointed and then an orbit continuously refined over weeks ([Rocket that slammed into the moon last year ID'ed as Chinese vehicle | Space](https://www.space.com/moon-crash-march-2022-china-rocket-body#:~:text=On March 4%2C 2022%2C a,slam into the lunar surface)). If weather or scheduling had prevented some observations, the object could have “gone dark.” Maintaining custody (continuous knowledge of an object’s whereabouts) is thus a prime challenge. It’s one thing to spot something once; it’s another to not lose it over time. Cislunar SSA will need automated sensor tasking to ensure objects don’t slip away when they pass from one field of view to another – a task tailor-made for advanced algorithms (as discussed in the next section).
Object Identification and Characterization: Beyond just tracking orbits, situational awareness means identifying what an object is (satellite? debris? payload?) and its intentions or capabilities. In cislunar space this can be even harder than in Earth orbit. Objects are farther and less frequently observed, so we get less detailed signatures. Optical light curves or spectra can sometimes distinguish materials (as was done to identify the Chinese booster by its paint spectra ([Rocket that slammed into the moon last year ID'ed as Chinese vehicle | Space](https://www.space.com/moon-crash-march-2022-china-rocket-body#:~:text=One of the teams that,to the point of confirmation))), but such observations are rare. We also have fewer reference objects in cislunar space – our catalogs are sparse. If a new object appears, determining whose it is may require intelligence sharing or a process of elimination. Communication and transparency become critical: if organizations openly share launch and trajectory data for their missions, unknown objects in that vicinity can be cross-identified. When there’s silence (perhaps due to military secrecy or commercial proprietary concerns), uncertainty grows. The situation in 2021, when a Chinese spacecraft made an unannounced maneuver at a Lagrange point, exemplified this: absent any notification, only vigilant hobbyists and later analysis revealed the activity ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=Lagrange point near the moon,using equipment in their backyards)) ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=not been a pressing need,country has ever proactively undertaken)). Lack of agreed norms on notification means identification often lags behind events. This is not just a technical challenge but a policy one.
Policy and Data Sharing Gaps: Speaking of norms, today there is no formal space traffic management (STM) framework for cislunar space. The Outer Space Treaty’s Article XI calls for countries to share information about their space activities, but it’s voluntary and generally interpreted to apply to major missions, not every orbit change ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=not been a pressing need,country has ever proactively undertaken)). The Registration Convention requires launching states to register basic orbital parameters of objects, but this typically covers initial Earth orbit insertions and doesn’t mandate updates when spacecraft transfer to lunar orbit or beyond ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=not
In light of these challenges, it’s evident that cislunar situational awareness will not be achieved by a single silver-bullet solution. It requires a combination of technological innovation, architectural changes (more sensors in more places), and policy agreements. The next section explores the technological solutions and innovations underway to address the technical hurdles, while a later section will delve into policy and collaborative frameworks needed to complement the tech.

Technological Solutions and Innovations for Cislunar Monitoring
Addressing the difficulties of cislunar SSA calls for cutting-edge technologies and new operating concepts. Below we discuss key solution areas – from advanced telescopes and radars to on-orbit sensors and artificial intelligence – highlighting how each contributes to better tracking and monitoring of lunar-space objects.

Enhanced Optical and Infrared Tracking
Optical observation will remain a backbone of cislunar tracking, but it is being enhanced through larger apertures, new sensor modalities, and smarter scheduling:

Wide-Field Survey Telescopes: To discover and track unknown objects, wide sky coverage is crucial. The Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) now operated jointly by the U.S. and Australia is one example – it has a curved focal plane that provides a wide field of view at high sensitivity, ideal for scanning GEO and beyond. Future systems, such as proposed next-generation SSA telescopes, aim to cover the cislunar volume more systematically. By surveying regions around the Moon’s orbital path or Lagrange points, these telescopes can pick up faint objects that current narrower-field instruments might miss. Research is ongoing into optimized search patterns and sensor tasking. For instance, a 2021 Purdue/AAS paper explored using deep reinforcement learning to optimally point telescopes for cislunar object search, improving the odds of catching short-lived opportunities ([(PDF) Cislunar Space Situational Awareness Sensor Tasking using ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365244624_Cislunar_Space_Situational_Awareness_Sensor_Tasking_using_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_Agents#:~:text=,optical telescope for cislunar)) ([[PDF] Cislunar Space Situational Awareness Sensor Tasking](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Poster/Siew.pdf#:~:text=,optical telescope for cislunar)). Similarly, AMOS conference 2023 papers discussed “SPACEDUST” wide-field optical concepts for space surveillance ([2023 Technical Papers - AMOS Conference](https://amostech.com/2023-technical-papers/#:~:text=2023 Technical Papers ,FOV Space Situational Awareness)). These innovations suggest that future optical systems will be more automated and intelligent in how they scan the skies.
Infrared Sensors: Traditional SSA optics work in visible light, detecting sunlight reflected off objects. In cislunar space, an object might be in darkness (e.g., passing through Earth’s shadow) and effectively invisible in reflected light. Infrared sensors, especially thermal infrared, can detect the object’s own heat emission, which could make it visible even when the Sun isn’t shining on it. Mid-wave infrared (MWIR, ~3–5 µm) and long-wave IR (LWIR, ~8–14 µm) sensors are being considered to complement visible light telescopes () (). A satellite or debris that is warming in sunlight or cooling in eclipse might emit a detectable heat signature. Space-based IR sensors (on satellites) could also spot objects against the cold background of space without Earth’s atmospheric interference. The U.S. military has experience with space-based IR for missile warning, and some of that technology could be adapted for object tracking (for example, tuning algorithms to pick up slow-moving, cold objects instead of fast hot missiles). Multispectral approaches – combining visible and IR observations – can help overcome the “exclusion zones” where one method fails (e.g. in eclipse, use IR; when an object is sunlit and reflective, use visible) (). This diversity of optical sensing improves resilience of tracking.
Distributed Optical Networks: No single telescope, no matter how advanced, can monitor the entire cislunar space continuously. Hence, there’s a push toward networks of optical sensors, potentially on multiple continents (or even multiple celestial bodies). A distributed network can follow an object continuously by handing off observations as Earth rotates or as the object moves. Commercial SSA providers are already networking dozens of telescopes for GEO surveillance; extending this model to cislunar means adding more sites and coordination. Additionally, studies like the APL VLBI project indicate placing even one telescope in space (for instance, a small optical telescope on a satellite at high Earth orbit or lunar orbit) and networking it with ground telescopes can dramatically improve tracking precision ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=Fowler’s team conducted a simulation,exciting improvement in tracking ability)) ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=Because it would be stationed,system would help even more)). This effectively creates a huge “virtual aperture” via interferometry or concurrent angles, pinpointing object positions more accurately. In practice, an architecture might involve one or two space-based optical platforms in stable orbits (like Earth-Moon L1 or L2) scanning for objects and relaying data to analysts on Earth. Such concepts are being actively considered by the U.S. Space Force and others. In fact, the upcoming CHPS/Oracle experiment (described below) will carry an optical sensor suite to test space-based detection of cislunar objects ().
Adaptive Optics and Image Processing: To get usable data on tiny, distant objects, advanced image processing is key. Techniques like long-exposure stacking, streak detection algorithms, and AI-based image enhancement are being applied to telescope data to pull out extremely faint streaks that indicate a moving object. Some research leverages machine learning for pattern recognition in optical images – e.g., distinguishing a true object trail from noise or cosmic rays. The U.S. Space Force’s Space Systems Command has several AI/ML projects for “dim object tracking” using telescope data ([Facilitating Intelligent Conversations About Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ssc.spaceforce.mil/Newsroom/Article-Display/Article/3846301/facilitating-intelligent-conversations-about-artificial-intelligence#:~:text=Facilitating Intelligent Conversations About Artificial,target tracking. Machine learning)). These algorithms can learn from known orbital signatures and help predict where to find an object next, essentially guiding telescopes intelligently rather than brute-force scanning.
In sum, optical tracking is evolving to meet cislunar needs: larger eyes on the sky, more spectral bands, and smarter brains behind the eyes (AI for detection and sensor scheduling). These improvements will help mitigate the distance and intermittency issues, though they will be complemented by other sensor types for a complete picture.

High-Power Radar and Communication Systems
Radar remains a powerful tool, especially for precise measurements and all-weather/night coverage. Innovations here include:

Phased Array “Space Fence” Extensions: The U.S. Space Fence radar (located on Kwajalein Atoll) is designed for LEO tracking with incredible sensitivity, but it is theoretically capable of seeing objects at higher orbits under certain conditions. Future upgrades or supplementary sites might tune such phased arrays to scan cislunar trajectories. Additionally, the concept of a bistatic radar using multiple transmit and receive sites could extend range – for instance, one site transmits a strong signal and another, far away, listens for the return. This could enlarge the baseline and improve detection of distant echoes. The commercial deep-space radar mentioned by COMSPOC likely uses modern phased array tech to achieve long range (). As demand grows, more such radars could be deployed (perhaps one in each hemisphere for global coverage). They could automatically sweep through likely transit corridors (e.g., common transfer orbit paths) to catch objects heading to or from the Moon.
Planetary Defense Radars: Both NASA and CNSA (China) are investing in systems to detect and track near-Earth objects (NEOs) like asteroids, some of which come through cislunar space. For example, NASA is upgrading its Goldstone and other radars, and China announced plans to build a monitoring and warning system for asteroids by mid-2020s (). These systems, while aimed upward for natural objects, could serendipitously pick up man-made objects. The hardware needed (large antennas, high power) is similar. In fact, asteroid trackers often find lost rocket boosters or high-altitude debris during surveys. By coordinating planetary defense and SSA efforts, the data can be shared. We might see a model where an asteroid survey radar also provides orbital data on any artificial object it sees, feeding a cislunar catalog.
Communication Signal Exploitation: Every active spacecraft in cislunar space emits some form of communication or navigation signal. Technology is being developed to use these signals for tracking passively. Interferometry between multiple listening stations (VLBI, as demonstrated by APL) can pinpoint a source’s location to high precision ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=Often used in radio astronomy%2C,the resolution of the observation)) ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=The technique is typically used,spacecraft in the cislunar region)). Even if one doesn’t have a dedicated transmit radar, simply using the spacecraft’s own radio transmissions (telemetry, radio beacons) as “signals of opportunity” can yield its trajectory. The limitation is that this only works for cooperative targets that are transmitting. However, with NASA’s Artemis architecture, for instance, all crewed vehicles and many probes will likely be broadcasting for communications and navigation (think of the Lunar Gateway, Orion, etc.). Setting up a network of passive antennas to continuously listen for these signals is a cost-effective way to augment SSA. Projects are underway to integrate such passive RF sensing into SSA frameworks – one advantage is that RF can work in all lighting and weather, and is not affected by the target being in eclipse (unlike optical) ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=“By itself%2C VLBI is not,”)). As optical communications (laser comm) become more popular, this method faces a challenge (lasers are hard to detect unless you’re in the direct line), but for the near term most lunar missions still rely on RF comms ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=In
Onboard Transponders and Navigation Signals: Technological solutions also include making the targets easier to track. There is discussion of equipping future satellites or even upper stages bound for cislunar space with GPS-like transponders or reflectors. For example, the LunaNet architecture proposed by NASA involves a lunar communications and navigation network where users (spacecraft) can obtain their position but also presumably can be tracked by the network. ESA’s Moonlight project plans to put navigation satellites around the Moon by 2028, which will broadcast signals like a lunar GPS ([Europe launches ambitious 'Moonlight' program to support lunar ...](https://www.space.com/europe-moonlight-program-lunar-navigation-communications#:~:text=,autonomous landings and surface mobility)). Spacecraft using those signals for navigation inherently make themselves trackable to the network. This doesn’t solve tracking of uncooperative objects, but it means cooperative actors will have highly accurate, shareable state vectors. If all Artemis Accord members, for instance, agree to use a common system and share data, a cislunar traffic management picture can be built with less reliance on external sensing for those objects. Essentially, technology to self-report positions (like AIS beacons in maritime use, or transponders in air traffic) could be adopted for lunar space missions to enhance short-term tracking and collision avoidance.
Space-Based Surveillance Platforms
Perhaps the most game-changing development for cislunar SSA is the deployment of dedicated space-based sensors in cislunar space. Positioning at least some of our “eyes and ears” off the Earth dramatically improves coverage and sensitivity. Key initiatives include:

Cislunar Patrol Satellites (e.g. CHPS/Oracle): The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory’s Cislunar Highway Patrol System (CHPS) – now renamed Oracle – is a pioneering mission designed explicitly to surveil the cislunar region ([Advanced Space Awarded Contract to Deliver Air Force Research Laboratory’s Mission to the Moon | Advanced Space](https://advancedspace.com/afrl-awards-oracle-contract/#:~:text=Capabilities Office%2C has awarded the,solutions for this challenging mission)). ** (Advanced Space Awarded Contract to Deliver Air Force Research Laboratory’s Mission to the Moon | Advanced Space)** Concept art of the Cislunar Highway Patrol System (CHPS/“Oracle”) monitoring the space around the Moon. The Oracle spacecraft (scheduled for launch in 2025) will operate near the Earth–Moon L1 point and carry both wide-field and narrow-field optical sensors to discover and track objects around the Moon (). Onboard image processing and orbit determination software will autonomously catalog objects it observes (). The goal is to demonstrate foundational capabilities: detecting mission-related debris, spent rocket bodies, or uncooperative objects in cislunar space, and providing positional updates on active spacecraft in lunar orbits that are hard to see from Earth (). Oracle will also test navigation and communication techniques for operations at 385,000 km range, informing how a future operational system might work () (). In essence, CHPS/Oracle is a “space-based space surveillance” prototype for the cislunar regime, analogous to how the SBSS and GSSAP satellites provide surveillance in Earth orbit. If successful, it will pave the way for a constellation or network of such patrol craft, giving continuous watch over cislunar key areas. Notably, Oracle’s development is a collaborative effort with private industry (Advanced Space is the prime contractor, with partners like General Atomics for the spacecraft bus and Leidos for the optical payload ([Advanced Space Awarded Contract to Deliver Air Force Research Laboratory’s Mission to the Moon | Advanced Space](https://advancedspace.com/afrl-awards-oracle-contract/#::text=said Bradley Cheetham%2C Chief Executive,”))), illustrating how civil, military, and commercial expertise are merging to solve this challenge. The data from Oracle will likely be shared with both Space Force and NASA, as it serves dual aims (security and safety for Artemis missions) ([Advanced Space Awarded Contract to Deliver Air Force Research Laboratory’s Mission to the Moon | Advanced Space](https://advancedspace.com/afrl-awards-oracle-contract/#:~:text=,to support future NASA missions)).
Lunar Orbiters with SSA Payloads: While Oracle is a dedicated SSA mission, other nations may piggyback SSA sensors on science orbiters. For instance, China’s upcoming Chang’e 7 mission (mid-2020s) will have an orbiter component orbiting the Moon for years (). If equipped with a modest optical sensor pointed outward, such an orbiter could catalog new arrivals in lunar orbit (the same way meteorological satellites occasionally spot other satellites). There have been proposals for “Lagrange sentinels” – small satellites at Earth–Moon L4 or L5 (the stable Lagrange points leading or trailing the Moon’s orbit) that could monitor transiting objects. These are still conceptual, but space agencies are studying how their lunar infrastructure might contribute to SSA. Even the NASA Lunar Gateway could host sensors to observe cislunar space or serve as a relay for tracking data from other craft.
Space-Based SIGINT/ELINT for Space: Another approach is deploying space-based receivers that listen for electronic signals from spacecraft (essentially a SIGINT satellite for the cislunar environment). By being closer, they could pick up faint telemetry or radar emissions that Earth-based antennas might miss. The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) hasn’t stated anything publicly, but one can envision in future an NRO satellite parked at a high orbit to eavesdrop on any RF emanations in cislunar space – that would doubly serve SSA by detecting active transmissions (hence active spacecraft). This blurs the line between intelligence and SSA, highlighting the dual-use nature of technology.
Autonomous Constellations: Looking further ahead, one can imagine a distributed network of small satellites spread around cislunar space, coordinating to detect objects. For example, a trio of nanosatellites in NRHO (near-rectilinear halo orbit around the Moon) spaced at intervals could jointly observe the space around the Moon with optical or RF sensors, triangulating positions. They might communicate via a lunar relay (like NASA’s proposed LunaNet) and use onboard AI to flag unusual events or new objects. Autonomy would be key due to light-time delays and limited ground contacts – these satellites would share data and compute orbits cooperatively on orbit. Such swarms could be the 2030s equivalent of today’s ground radar fence, but in space. The advantage is persistent presence in cislunar, but challenges include maintaining the constellation and communication links.
Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics
Given the volume of data and complexity of cislunar operations, AI and machine learning (ML) technologies are indispensable for timely and effective space situational awareness. They contribute in several ways:

Automated Data Processing: AI enables the automated processing and interpretation of vast, diverse datasets coming from optical telescopes, radars, satellite telemetry, and more ([AI-Enabled Cislunar Space Situational Awareness | KeAi Publishing](https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/space-habitation/call-for-papers/ai-enabled-cislunar-space-situational-awareness/#:~:text=Artificial intelligence ,These)). Unlike low Earth orbit, where objects orbit in a few hours and can produce frequent passes, cislunar objects move slowly and irregularly – generating sparser data that still needs to be connected. Machine learning algorithms can sift through noisy observations to correlate which ones likely belong to the same object (data association problem). They can also filter out false detections. Techniques such as deep learning and computer vision are already being applied to recognize satellite streaks in astronomical images or detect anomalies in radar returns ([AI-Enabled Cislunar Space Situational Awareness | KeAi Publishing](https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/space-habitation/call-for-papers/ai-enabled-cislunar-space-situational-awareness/#:~:text=Artificial
Orbit Prediction and Maneuver Detection: ML can augment traditional orbital dynamics by learning patterns or by quickly adjusting to new data. High-precision three-body orbit propagators are computationally heavy; a trained neural network surrogate could predict an object’s future position faster, albeit with some trade-off in generality. Additionally, change detection algorithms can flag when a spacecraft’s trajectory deviates from the expected (indicating a possible maneuver or perturbation). Some research has looked at using reinforcement learning to plan optimal tracking strategies – essentially AI “agents” that decide which sensor should observe which object next to minimize uncertainty ([(PDF) Cislunar Space Situational Awareness Sensor Tasking using ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365244624_Cislunar_Space_Situational_Awareness_Sensor_Tasking_using_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_Agents#:~:text=,optical telescope for cislunar)) ([[PDF] Cislunar Space Situational Awareness Sensor Tasking](https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2022/Poster/Siew.pdf#:~:text=,optical telescope for cislunar)). Over time, AI could handle routine catalog maintenance, freeing human analysts to focus on interpreting unusual behaviors or higher-level decision-making.
Behavioral Modeling: Beyond physics, AI can help model and predict object behavior. For example, a machine learning model could ingest historical data on how certain satellites (or debris) move in cislunar space – perhaps learning that a particular piece of rocket body always tumbles and changes brightness in a certain way, or that a competitor’s lunar spacecraft tends to enter specific orbits. It could then recognize when something doesn’t fit the pattern. Natural language processing (NLP) is even relevant: AI can monitor streams of unstructured data (like news releases, social media, commercial tracking feeds) to catch hints of new launches or operations, providing context to the SSA system ([AI-Enabled Cislunar Space Situational Awareness | KeAi Publishing](https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/space-habitation/call-for-papers/ai-enabled-cislunar-space-situational-awareness/#:~:text=Artificial intelligence ,These)). An example cited in a 2025 call for papers is the concept of DeepSeek, a lightweight large-scale AI model for real-time data analysis and autonomous cislunar surveillance ([AI-Enabled Cislunar Space Situational Awareness | KeAi Publishing](https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/space-habitation/call-for-papers/ai-enabled-cislunar-space-situational-awareness/#:~:text=datasets%2C including remote sensing imagery%2C,of space situational awareness frameworks)). While details on DeepSeek are scant, it symbolizes the drive towards AI that can handle real-time fusion and decision-making – exactly what’s needed if, say, multiple unknown objects appear and one needs to prioritize which to observe first to avoid losing them.
Onboard Autonomy: AI is not just for ground systems; it’s also moving onboard satellites. The CHPS/Oracle satellite will carry novel on-board image processing and orbit determination software to autonomously process what it sees and determine orbits without immediate ground input (). This is a form of edge AI – allowing the spacecraft to sift through stars and detect moving objects in its camera view by itself. In scenarios where communications are delayed or limited, such autonomy ensures timely action (like cueing a narrow-field sensor to zoom in on a detected object). Space-based AI could even decide if an object is interesting enough to report immediately or if it can wait, optimizing bandwidth by sending only meaningful alerts. The trend is towards smart satellites that cooperate as an intelligent network rather than just dumb sensors feeding a central brain.
Simulation and Training: Lastly, AI helps in creating realistic simulations (“digital twins”) of the cislunar environment to test our tracking and decision processes. By simulating thousands of objects and potential maneuvers (using AI to introduce random but plausible behaviors), analysts can train algorithms and operators to recognize and respond to events. This builds the intuition and mental models that experts have noted are currently lacking for this new domain ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=defined,interference in the first place)).
In conclusion, technology is rapidly advancing on multiple fronts to improve cislunar situational awareness. Wide-field optical surveys, infrared sensors, and powerful radars will enhance detection; space-based patrol sats like Oracle will extend our reach; and AI/ML will tie everything together efficiently and intelligently. Many of these solutions are synergistic – for example, an AI might use both radar and optical data to characterize an object, or a space-based sensor might cue a ground telescope for follow-up. A hybrid sensing strategy is emerging, where optical, RF, and onboard sensors complement each other to cover for individual limitations ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=As a passive radio frequency,the perspective of the observer)). For instance, when a target is not emitting any signal (radio-silent debris), optical methods take priority; when the target is obscured optically (in darkness or behind the Moon), passive RF or other sensors can take over ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=“By itself%2C VLBI is not,”)) ([Johns Hopkins APL Is Setting the Path to Prevent Traffic Jams in Space | Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/221205-apl-cislunar-traffic-management#:~:text=As

Having explored the technical landscape, we now turn to the policy and international collaboration dimension – a critical enabler for cislunar SSA that must evolve in parallel with technology.

Policy Frameworks, International Collaboration, and Regulatory Aspects
Technological capability alone will not guarantee effective situational awareness in cislunar space – policy and cooperation are equally important. The challenges noted earlier around lack of notifications and data sharing suggest that new frameworks are needed to manage cislunar traffic and prevent misunderstandings. In this section, we discuss existing treaties and policies, ongoing initiatives for cooperation, and the regulatory developments (or gaps) that affect cislunar SSA.

Existing Space Treaties and their Limitations
The foundational space law instruments (the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and related agreements) were drafted when only a handful of Earth or lunar missions existed, and they did not explicitly contemplate today’s busy cislunar operations:

The Outer Space Treaty (OST) establishes broad principles. Notably, Article I declares space (including Moon and cislunar space) free for exploration and use by all countries, and Article VI requires states to supervise the activities of their nationals, including private companies. Article IX calls for “due regard” to avoid harmful interference and suggests consultation if one state’s activities might conflict with another’s. While these principles imply a need for communication and coordination, they lack specific mechanisms. For example, OST Article XI only asks that states inform the world of the “nature, conduct, locations, and results” of their space activities “to the greatest extent feasible and practicable” ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=not been a pressing need,country has ever proactively undertaken)). In practice this has meant press releases about major missions or science discoveries, not granular orbit updates. Thus, OST encourages transparency in spirit but doesn’t mandate sharing precise SSA data.
The Registration Convention (1975) requires states to register every object they launch into space with the UN, including basic orbital parameters. Most spacefaring nations comply by submitting entries to the UN Register (managed by UNOOSA). However, the Convention’s requirements are minimal – an object’s general orbital class (e.g., Earth orbit vs. lunar trajectory) is given, but there’s no ongoing update mandate. Once a satellite is registered, a state doesn’t have to announce if it later moves to a new orbit (though some do voluntarily). Crucially for cislunar, if a satellite leaves Earth orbit for lunar orbit, there’s no treaty obligation to update its status. The War on the Rocks analysis points out that while OST Article IX and others imply an expectation of ongoing supervision, “no country has ever proactively undertaken or requested consultations” under those provisions for orbital changes ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=notify about activities of objects,filed by China regarding the)). So legally, a nation could launch a probe to lunar space and, beyond the initial launch notification, remain silent on its trajectory. This is a gap that makes SSA harder – one has to rely on detection rather than being informed.
The Moon Agreement (1979), which few nations have joined (and neither the U.S. nor China), aimed to govern activities on the Moon and other celestial bodies, but it too didn’t establish concrete traffic rules or SSA protocols. It focused more on resource use and jurisdiction.
Given these limitations, there is a growing recognition that cislunar space needs updated norms or agreements to handle the increased activity. For instance, one suggestion has been to extend the concept of “notification of planned maneuvers” (common in geostationary orbit to avoid radio interference) to the cislunar realm. Another is to use Article IX’s consultation clause more liberally – e.g., if Nation A plans a large lunar landing that might create a lot of orbital debris, they consult with others beforehand. However, without a formal STM regime, much depends on goodwill.

National Policies and Strategies
Individual countries have started developing policies that, while not binding internationally, signal priorities and can shape international norms:

The United States released a National Cislunar Science & Technology Strategy in 2022. One of its high-level objectives is to “Extend U.S. space situational awareness capabilities into cislunar space.” () It explicitly notes that SSA is “essential to safe and successful spacecraft operations in all orbits, including in cislunar space” (), and calls for defining requirements for new SSA capabilities and data-sharing approaches (). In an accompanying action plan, the U.S. government is tasked to develop procedures for publicly sharing cislunar SSA data and providing navigation and safety support (). This indicates a policy shift towards more openness, akin to how the U.S. already shares a catalog of Earth-orbit debris and satellites via Space-Track. The idea would be to include cislunar objects in a public database to enhance transparency. Additionally, U.S. Space Force leadership has been vocal about needing to surveil cislunar space in the next few years to defend interests ([Cislunar Highway Patrol System - Air & Space Forces Magazine](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/tag/cislunar-highway-patrol-system/#:~:text=Cislunar Highway Patrol System ,interests on and around)). This has led to funding programs like CHPS/Oracle and partnerships with commercial SSA firms. Domestically, the U.S. is also discussing which agency will handle “Space Traffic Management” for civil space – currently, Commerce (Office of Space Commerce) is slated to take on civil SSA data dissemination. One can expect that as Artemis missions ramp up, NASA will coordinate with Space Force and Commerce to ensure an open feed of Artemis-related positional data to avoid any incidents.
China has not published a standalone cislunar SSA policy, but its actions speak to a strategic interest in the domain. Chinese military writings frequently mention space as a warfighting domain and emphasize not ceding the high ground. An Air University study in 2022 notes that China lacks dedicated cislunar SSA sensors now but is taking steps to build them in 5–10 years, possibly leveraging its planetary exploration tracking network (). China’s government has also announced plans for a “situational awareness system” as part of its asteroid defense effort by mid-decade (). Geopolitically, China and Russia’s partnership on the ILRS (International Lunar Research Station) implies they will develop their own communications, navigation, and presumably tracking systems around the Moon. If separate from U.S./partner systems, this raises the importance of some data exchange to avoid interference. China’s space policy emphasizes peaceful use and has called for working under the UN framework (China is not part of Artemis Accords). In 2021, China did file a note verbale to the UN complaining about Starlink satellites nearly colliding with its space station – referencing OST Article V and IX obligations. This unprecedented move suggests China expects notification of potentially risky activities. One could extrapolate that if the U.S. or others had a vehicle in lunar orbit near a Chinese mission and didn’t coordinate, China might raise it diplomatically. So there is an impetus on all sides to improve communication channels.
Other Players: Other nations involved in lunar projects, like India or Japan, generally follow similar practices – they register missions and sometimes publish orbital elements for their probes. India’s Chandrayaan-2 orbiter, for instance, has its ephemeris available in public archives for researchers. This kind of voluntary sharing is good for science and safety. The European Space Agency and its member states are Artemis Accord signatories and likely to align with the U.S. approach of transparency (ESA’s Lunar Pathfinder commsat will likely be used by many and hence share its position openly). One noteworthy concept is the Artemis Accords (2020) – a non-binding set of principles for nations participating in NASA’s lunar efforts. Among other things, the Accords call for release of scientific data publicly and advance notification of activities that might cause harmful interference, including the proposal of “Safety Zones” around lunar operations to avoid accidental incursions ([Artemis Accords - NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/artemis-accords/#:~:text=Safety zones will be temporary%2C,principle of free access)) ([[PDF] accords - UNOOSA](https://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/WSF/2020/Presentations/Exploration/Presentation_2.pdf#:~:text='Safety Zones',harmful interference%2C implementing Article)). While the term “safety zones” raised debate (some fear it implies territoriality, which is forbidden by OST), in essence it means if, say, NASA is landing at a certain site, they’d inform others to stay clear of that area for a time. This is directly related to situational awareness – it’s about sharing where and when things will happen. If widely adopted, it creates a norm of prior notification for major maneuvers or activities in cislunar space.
International Collaboration Mechanisms
Achieving comprehensive cislunar SSA will likely require international collaboration, given the global nature of sensors and the fact that no one country can cover the entire sky all the time. Some collaborative mechanisms include:

Combined Data Sharing: The model used in Earth orbit (e.g., U.S. sharing conjunction warnings globally) could extend to cislunar. The U.S. Space Command already provides SSA services to other satellite operators; in the future, it could provide cislunar trajectory sharing. Conversely, if another country detects an object (say, a Russian radar picks up something in transit to the Moon), sharing that info through multilateral channels could benefit everyone. Bodies like the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) might in time consider cislunar debris (though currently they focus on Earth orbits). The Combined Space Operations (CSpO) initiative, involving the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, etc., is a military partnership for space domain awareness among allies. It could serve as a forum to pool cislunar tracking data, including from allied telescopes or radars distributed around the world.
United Nations and COPUOS: The UN Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has been discussing Long-Term Sustainability (LTS) guidelines for space activities. One guideline encourages information sharing on space objects and events. While current guidelines don’t explicitly mention cislunar, the spirit applies. As lunar activity grows, COPUOS may take up topics like coordinating orbits around the Moon to avoid interference (similar to how GEO slots and spectrum are coordinated via the ITU for communications satellites). Another UN avenue is the Transparency and Confidence-Building Measures (TCBMs) in outer space activities – voluntary measures that include notifications of launches, sharing SSA observations, etc. These TCBMs could be expanded for cislunar context to reduce the risk of misperception (for example, if one nation sees an object but isn’t sure whose it is, a quick communication could clarify it’s a scientific probe, not a weapon).
Artemis Accords Coalition: Countries in the Artemis Accords (which include most major space nations except China/Russia) are establishing working relationships. Through Artemis, NASA has encouraged open data policies – for instance, NASA’s Lunar Recon Orbiter data (including any found new impacts or objects) is publicly available. If all partners follow suit, a large pool of civil data will be openly accessible. Moreover, the Accords members might set up a coordination group specifically for deconflicting lunar activities. This could act as a proto-traffic management authority. For example, if both Japan and India plan orbiters in 2030, they might coordinate through the Artemis framework to ensure different orbital altitudes or inclinations to avoid conjunctions, and share their ephemerides with each other.
ILRS and Other Coalitions: Meanwhile, the China/Russia-led ILRS will involve its own set of countries (as of 2024, China announced 13 countries involved () including e.g. Venezuela, South Africa, others). They will presumably share data amongst themselves for their operations. In the interest of overall safety, there should ideally be cross-communication between the Artemis group and ILRS group. Perhaps through neutral forums like the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) (which China is part of) or the Moon Village Association, dialogue can occur. One concrete area is the lunar communications and navigation standards – if both U.S. and China systems are interoperable or at least not interfering, that helps SSA (imagine a future where a Chinese lander could use a U.S. comm relay or vice versa in emergencies).
Norms for Close Approaches: A particular concern in cislunar space is if one nation’s satellite approaches another’s (inspection or potentially tampering). In Earth orbit, this has already happened (e.g., satellites “buzzing” others in GEO). In lunar space, norms are not set – but such behavior could be even more provocative given the distances and uncertainties. Confidence-building steps could include agreements like “we will not approach within X kilometers of another country’s active lunar asset without prior notice” (except for rescue or cooperative purposes). This would mirror maritime “rules of the road” to prevent incidents. While not formalized yet, major powers have hinted at wanting such norms – for instance, U.S. Space Force officials have talked about responsible behavior in cislunar to avoid “accidents” that could be seen as hostile.
Regulatory and Legal Aspects for the Future
Regulation of cislunar space is still in its infancy, but a few aspects are emerging:

Space Traffic Management (STM): The concept of STM may be extended beyond Earth orbits. Organizations like the U.S. Department of Commerce are looking at providing civil traffic coordination. Eventually, we might see space traffic rules for lunar orbit – e.g., recommended altitudes for polar orbiters vs equatorial orbiters, similar to how satellite orbits around Earth are structured to minimize collision risks. If a lunar satellite wants to change orbit, there might be a notice issued through a civil STM entity. This is not in place yet, but discussions are starting on how to not repeat the orbital debris problem around the Moon that we have around Earth. The recent incident of a used rocket stage hitting the Moon (and another expected in 2024) underscores that debris can reach the Moon too, and while impacts on the Moon don’t threaten assets in space, the uncertainty around those objects’ paths was essentially a STM concern (people wanted to know where it would go and what it was).
Licensing of Missions: National licensing authorities (like the FAA for launches, FCC for communications, etc., in the U.S.) might begin to incorporate cislunar considerations. For example, if a company wants to deploy a constellation around the Moon, the licensing entity could require a debris mitigation plan and sharing of orbital data, akin to requirements now in Earth orbit. This way, even commercial actors who are not under direct government operation still have to play by safety rules. As of now, licenses for lunar missions mostly cover launch and radio frequencies; but one can foresee conditions ensuring they don’t leave junk in unstable orbits that could later threaten others.
Resource Zones and Safety Areas: The Artemis Accords safety zones concept – though not legally binding – might evolve into accepted practice. If a safety zone is declared (e.g., a 1 km radius around a landing site during operations), other parties might voluntarily honor it. This has regulatory implications if, say, someone inadvertently enters a zone – it could be seen as an unsafe act. Defining how these zones are communicated (perhaps via a Notices to Space Mariners bulletin) will be part of cislunar coordination. Importantly, safety zones are temporary and specific, so they shouldn’t be misconstrued as territorial claims ([Artemis Accords - NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/artemis-accords/#:~:text=Safety zones will be temporary%2C,principle of free access)). But they help SSA by giving everyone expected coordinates and times of events.
Global Catalog and Notification System: A potential development is an international cislunar object catalog maintained by a neutral entity (maybe the UN or a coalition). The U.S. catalog might serve as a basis, but including inputs from all. This is analogous to air traffic control having radar from various regions integrated. It could start with something as simple as a shared website where countries voluntarily post orbital elements of their cislunar spacecraft for others to see. Over time, trust in such a system can grow, especially if it proves useful in avoiding mishaps.
In summary, while the legal/regulatory framework for cislunar space is currently fragmentary, the trajectory is toward greater transparency and coordination. Countries recognize that without it, the risk of miscalculation or accidents increases. Encouragingly, the major spacefaring nations all publicly state support for “peaceful, responsible” use of cislunar space. The geopolitical reality, however, is that strategic competition could either spur more cooperation (to avoid conflict) or lead to parallel, non-cooperative approaches (dueling “spheres of influence” around the Moon). The next few years – as Artemis, Chang’e, and other programs unfold – will set precedents. If those missions proceed with open communication (e.g., sharing tracking data and respecting each other’s operations), it bodes well for a normative framework that incorporates SSA as a shared responsibility.

Future Trends, Strategic Considerations, and Recommendations
Looking ahead, it’s clear that cislunar situational awareness will only grow in importance. By the 2030s, the space between Earth and Moon could host a bustling ecosystem of spacecraft from numerous countries and companies. Below, we outline key future trends, strategic considerations that arise from them, and recommendations to prepare for and shape this future.

Future Trends in Cislunar Activity and SSA
Dramatic Increase in Cislunar Traffic: Building on current forecasts, the late 2020s and 2030s will see not just one-off missions but continuous traffic to and from the Moon. NASA’s Artemis program envisions a regular cadence of crewed Orion flights, lander missions, and rotating Gateway crews. China’s ILRS might involve periodic cargo transports and eventually crewed visits around 2030+. Commercial ventures (like SpaceX’s Starship delivering payloads or tourists) could further add to launches. This implies a quasi “transportation corridor” between Earth and Moon with multiple objects in transit at any given time. Space situational awareness will need to evolve into space traffic management – analogous to air traffic control – at least for cooperative actors. Short-term tracking of newly launched trans-lunar injection stages, insertion into lunar orbit, and return trajectories to Earth (like crew capsules coming back) will become routine tasks.
Growth of Lunar Orbital Infrastructure: We will likely have satellites orbiting the Moon permanently: communications relays, navigation satellites (Moonlight), science platforms, perhaps even a fuel depot or two. The lunar far side might host a radio telescope array, requiring communication satellites above. Each of these assets becomes a new object to track (though they will be cooperative). The more assets, the more chances of interference if not managed – for example, two satellites accidentally ending up in similar orbits. Thus conjunction assessment and collision avoidance will become relevant around the Moon as well. Today, collision avoidance is a big part of LEO operations; tomorrow, NASA and others might have to dodge not only debris at Earth but also ensure, say, their lunar orbiter doesn’t collide with another nation’s orbiter. The community will need to extend collision screening procedures and tools (which currently handle Earth orbits) to lunar orbits.
Space Debris and Artifact Accumulation: With increased activity comes the byproduct of debris. Discarded rocket stages in lunar transfer orbits, components jettisoned (like adapter rings, empty fuel tanks), and defunct smallsats could litter cislunar space. The 2022 booster impact was perhaps the first known instance of space junk unintentionally reaching the Moon, but it won’t be the last. Some of this debris will crash into the Moon or escape Earth-Moon system, but some could get stuck in weird orbits (for instance, distant Earth orbits that linger for years). This creates a long-term tracking need: even after missions end, their remnants must be cataloged. Agencies should start applying debris mitigation guidelines beyond Earth orbit: e.g., ideally disposing of spent stages into safe graveyard or impact trajectories where they won’t threaten active routes. One trend might be mission designs that deliberately de-orbit hardware onto the Moon (where it can’t hit anything except lunar dust) or cast them into solar orbit rather than leaving them drifting near the Moon. Regardless, SSA networks will have to incorporate debris tracking beyond Earth. This might require improved sensors because the debris could be small and not transmitting.
Strategic Military Posture in Cislunar: As cislunar becomes strategically important, there is potential for an arms race or military competition in that domain. One country might deploy surveillance or early-warning systems at cislunar distances (for example, a missile warning satellite parked at Earth-Moon L2 to get a unique vantage point of Earth’s hemisphere). Another might test anti-satellite capabilities in cislunar space or pre-position counterspace assets. These possibilities mean military planners will treat cislunar SSA as part of their deterrence and defense strategy. By 2030, the U.S. Space Force’s “Space Domain Awareness” mission will explicitly extend to the Moon. We could see a dedicated command-and-control framework for xGEO space, and perhaps even rules of engagement for cislunar space. Ensuring that strategic activities don’t lead to misunderstanding will be crucial – hence the earlier emphasis on norms. A positive trend would be if major powers can agree on certain limits (for example, no destructive ASAT tests in cislunar space, or refraining from interfering with another’s critical lunar infrastructure). SSA will be the means to verify any such agreements, so investment in SSA has an arms-control verification angle too.
Advances in Technology to Watch: The technological march will continue. We may see quantum sensors (like quantum optical telescopes or gravimeters) that could detect mass concentrations or cloaked objects. Or AI-driven nano-sat swarms as earlier mentioned. By 2040, perhaps fully automated “watchkeeper” satellites patrol the Earth-Moon system, powered by solar energy and ion drives to reposition as needed. On the ground, the next generation of giant telescopes (30m class astronomy scopes) might also contribute incidental SSA data simply because they will see faint moving dots during their deep exposures. The boundary between scientific observation of asteroids and SSA observation of satellites will blur – especially if mega-constellations start expanding toward the Moon (not an immediate prospect, but conceivable if someone did a communications network stretching GEO to Moon).
Strategic Considerations for Stakeholders
Given these trends, some strategic points for different stakeholders:

For Civil Space Agencies (e.g., NASA, ESA): Prioritize spaceflight safety and interoperability. NASA will want to guarantee that when its astronauts are around the Moon, they are as safe from collisions or interference as astronauts in low Earth orbit are today. This means working hand-in-hand with DoD for awareness (as is happening with Artemis planning) and pushing international partners to share orbit data. Civil agencies also have a strategic interest in keeping cislunar space open and conflict-free, as scientific exploration thrives in a cooperative environment. Supporting the development of international space traffic management norms is in their interest. They may also invest in research for tracking natural hazards (meteoroids) that intersect with cislunar operations, which complements SSA for artificial objects.
For Military/Defense: Ensure space superiority or at least awareness in the new high ground. The U.S. Space Force and equivalents elsewhere will need to integrate cislunar data into their operations and possibly defend assets (like U.S. comm satellites at Lagrange points or allied infrastructure). They will likely treat cislunar SSA as part of Indications & Warning – e.g., noticing if an adversary repurposes a seemingly civilian mission for surveillance or if a new object appears that could be a threat. Strategically, they must also avoid misinterpreting benign actions as hostile (hence the need for intel and context). The establishment of something like a Cislunar Operations Cell at a space command center could happen, dedicated to monitoring that domain 24/7. Additionally, military strategists might consider how to build resilience – e.g., having redundant communication paths if one relay is attacked, or having rapid reconstitution (perhaps the idea of using cislunar space to stash spare satellites that can be moved to other orbits in wartime () ()). All these require excellent situational awareness to execute effectively.
For Commercial Operators: A stable and predictable cislunar environment is crucial for business. Companies will want clear “rules of the road” and access to trajectory data to plan their missions. A commercial lunar lander company, for example, will benefit if there’s a publicly available schedule of when and where others are operating to avoid radio frequency interference or navigation hazards. There is also a business opportunity: providing SSA services. Just as companies now sell orbital tracking data for satellites, in the future they could sell tailored cislunar tracking – perhaps a subscription where your spacecraft is constantly tracked by a network and you receive precision orbit updates and conjunction warnings. Companies like LeoLabs (with ground radars) or emerging startups could expand into this niche. Another angle is insurance and liability: as lunar missions become insurable, insurers will demand better SSA to price risk (e.g., risk of collision in orbit). This in turn pushes the sector towards better tracking and sharing of data. Strategically, commercial stakeholders can lobby for open data policies and participate in standard-setting (through forums like CCSDS for space communication, ensuring their systems can hook into global networks).
For International Governance: The 2020s will likely set the precedent and governance trajectory for cislunar space for decades. If cooperative norms take hold early (via Artemis Accords and other venues), they’ll be harder to undo – making it more likely that cislunar remains an area of collaboration even among competitors. Conversely, if we stumble early on (say there’s a major incident or close call that leads to diplomatic fallout), it could harden rival blocs and lead to a more fragmented approach to SSA (each side keeping secrets). It is strategically important for the international community to institutionalize data sharing and communication channels now. One recommendation floating in policy circles is the creation of an International Cislunar Traffic Management Center or expanding an existing entity like the SSA Sharepoint under the UN to cislunar. Even if just symbolic initially, having a go-to place for information reduces ambiguity.
Recommendations
Based on the above analysis, here are several concrete recommendations to enhance situational awareness of cislunar space targets and ensure effective short-term tracking and monitoring:

1. Invest in Dedicated Cislunar SSA Infrastructure: Space agencies and militaries should continue to fund missions like CHPS/Oracle and follow-ons, aiming for an operational network of cislunar surveillance satellites by the 2030s. This network could include assets at Lagrange points, in lunar orbit, and in highly-elliptical Earth orbits, to give multiple viewpoints of the cislunar volume. Similarly, augment ground infrastructure with a few more deep-space radars and telescopes strategically placed (e.g., one in the Southern Hemisphere, one in Eurasia, etc. for full longitudinal coverage). These investments pay off by ensuring no single point of failure in tracking coverage.

2. Develop Integrated Data Fusion Centers: Create a central (or federated) capability to fuse data from civil, military, and commercial sensors into a common operational picture. The U.S. could enhance its Space Surveillance Network software to handle three-body orbits and incorporate observations from NASA’s DSN, amateur networks, etc. This fused picture should be accessible at different classification levels so that, for example, an international version can be shared unclassified among partners or via the UN for transparency, while a classified high-detail version informs defense decisions. Essentially, a “Cislunar Space Catalog” should be established, with procedures for updating it in near-real-time as new data comes in.

3. Enhance Modeling and Simulation Tools: Urgently improve the software tools for cislunar orbit determination and prediction. Agencies should adopt or develop standards like NASA’s SPICE kernel format for trajectory sharing () (which is already used in deep-space science missions) rather than relying on TLEs. Concurrently, invest in better propagation algorithms that account for all relevant forces (perhaps AI-assisted as described). Providing open-source tools or APIs for conjunction assessment in cislunar orbits will allow even small players to be responsible actors (much as NASA provides a service for collision checking at Earth). Running regular simulation exercises – including wargames or tabletop exercises – with international participation can help train everyone on managing a hypothetical congested cislunar scenario, building the “mental models” needed ([Don’t Delay Getting Serious About Cislunar Security - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/dont-delay-getting-serious-about-cislunar-security/#:~:text=defined,interference in the first place)) to respond calmly to unexpected events.

4. Establish Communication Protocols and Notifications: Through diplomatic or multilateral channels, agree on voluntary notification protocols for key cislunar activities. For example, if a nation is inserting a spacecraft into a novel lunar orbit, they should announce the time and orbit parameters to others (perhaps via something like NOTAMs for space). Likewise, if an operator loses contact with a spacecraft in cislunar space (making it essentially uncontrolled), they should alert others so the object can be monitored as potential debris. This could be done under the umbrella of UN COPUOS guidelines or even as an extension of the Registration Convention (maybe states start providing updates as a best practice). Additionally, set up direct liaison networks: similar to how navies have the INCSEA agreements (Incidents at Sea) to directly communicate and resolve any concerning maneuvers, space agencies/militaries could have a hotline or coordination email for cislunar proximity events.

5. Leverage Artificial Intelligence Collaboratively: The development of AI for SSA should be shared to the extent possible. Allies could pool resources to create, for instance, an AI service for cislunar object tracking that all can use. This might be a cloud-based system where any accredited operator can submit sensor observations and get back fused orbit solutions. It would ensure even nations without huge SSA infrastructure can contribute and benefit (improving overall coverage). Furthermore, AI techniques for anomaly detection can be used to build trust – e.g., an AI might flag if one spacecraft starts shadowing another, enabling quick diplomatic intervention to clarify intent before tensions rise.

6. Strengthen International Norms and Agreements: Push for adoption of language in international fora that explicitly addresses cislunar operations. In the near term, expanding the Artemis Accords membership and detailing the implementation of safety zones and data sharing will create a large coalition following the same playbook. In the mid term, work through COPUOS to include cislunar-specific provisions in the next set of Long-Term Sustainability guidelines (LTS 2.0), such as “Actors should share trajectory data for missions in lunar orbits or trajectories, to enhance safety.” While voluntary, if major players follow them, they set expectations. In the long term, consider a new international agreement or an amendment to the Registration Convention to require registration of lunar orbit insertion and de-registration when objects crash or leave cislunar space, so the UN catalog isn’t left guessing. Also, globally ban intentional debris-causing events in cislunar space (no one wants a Kessler Syndrome around the Moon either).

7. Encourage Dual-Use Synergies: Since many cislunar SSA capabilities are dual-use, promote projects that serve both civil and military needs to maximize support. For example, a lunar GNSS (navigation satellite) could aid civil landing accuracy and also act as an SSA sensor node – funding such a system can be shared. Another idea is to use the lunar Gateway as a platform for monitoring: equip it with a sensor package that provides data to Space Force and also scientific data (much like how the U.S. air forces’ early DSP satellites also provided scientific observations of phenomena). By integrating SSA into multipurpose missions, we effectively crowdsource the surveillance job across different budgets and stakeholders.

8. Public Engagement and Transparency: Increase public release of cislunar SSA information to build confidence and deter malicious behavior. If all observations of cislunar objects (that are not sensitive) are made public, it leaves less room for suspicion. For instance, publish the orbital tracks of major mission components on platforms accessible to amateur trackers and academics. Encourage independent monitoring (like that done by universities for the 2022 rocket impact ([Rocket that slammed into the moon last year ID'ed as Chinese vehicle | Space](https://www.space.com/moon-crash-march-2022-china-rocket-body#:~:text=By Mike Wall published,16 November 2023)) ([Rocket that slammed into the moon last year ID'ed as Chinese vehicle | Space](https://www.space.com/moon-crash-march-2022-china-rocket-body#:~:text=One of the teams that,to the point of confirmation))) by supporting citizen science programs. When the public and international community can plainly see what’s happening, it’s harder for any actor to covertly prepare something nefarious without being noticed. This is akin to the role of open satellite imagery today in terrestrial security – broad SSA data can be a transparency tool.

In conclusion, situational awareness in cislunar space is transitioning from a niche concern to a mainstream requirement. The coming years will be pivotal in deploying the necessary sensors, forging cooperation, and setting norms. The technical challenges – vast distances, complex orbits, and sparse data – are being met with innovative solutions from wide-field optics to AI. Equally, the policy challenges – lack of frameworks and potential great-power competition – can be met with proactive diplomacy and confidence-building. By treating cislunar space as an extension of the human environment that demands the same diligence as air or maritime domains, we can avoid strategic surprises and ensure this new frontier remains safe and accessible.

With robust situational awareness, civil and commercial endeavors can flourish – astronauts will land safely, science will advance, and economic opportunities can be realized – all under the watchful eyes of a cooperative international monitoring system. At the same time, military stability can be preserved by reducing the unknowns and enhancing the ability to attribute actions in cislunar space (providing deterrence against hostile acts). In essence, building cislunar SSA is about extending humanity’s “radar” into the solar system, lighting up the darkness between Earth and Moon so that all can navigate and operate there with confidence and security.
