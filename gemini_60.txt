Comprehensive Strategies for Accurate Cislunar Space Situational Awareness and Short-Term Monitoring
Introduction
Context: The region of space between the Earth and the Moon, known as cislunar space, is experiencing an unprecedented surge in interest and activity. This renewed focus is driven by a confluence of factors, including ambitious government-led exploration programs like NASA's Artemis initiative and the international Gateway lunar outpost, burgeoning scientific opportunities, the potential for commercial resource exploitation on the Moon (such as water ice), and evolving national security considerations.1 Projections indicate a dramatic increase in traffic, with estimates suggesting over 100 lunar missions in the next decade and potentially around 250 missions planned for the cislunar region by the early 2030s.1 This includes crewed missions, robotic landers and orbiters, scientific probes, and commercial payload deliveries under initiatives like NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS).1

Problem Statement: This rapid expansion of activity transforms cislunar space from a sparsely populated domain into an increasingly congested and complex operational environment. Consequently, establishing and maintaining comprehensive Space Situational Awareness (SSA), also referred to as Space Domain Awareness (SDA) particularly in defense contexts, is paramount.7 Effective SSA/SDA enables transparency, ensures the safety of flight for all assets, protects critical infrastructure, and supports national security objectives in this strategic region.7 However, the existing SSA infrastructure and methodologies, primarily designed for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO), are fundamentally ill-suited for the unique challenges posed by the cislunar domain.6 The distinct physics governing motion and the sheer scale of cislunar space demand a paradigm shift. Simply extending near-Earth practices is insufficient; a new generation of technologies, algorithms, and operational concepts is required to achieve the necessary level of awareness.1

Finally, Section 6 synthesizes the analysis into actionable strategies and requirements for building a robust cislunar SSA ecosystem, followed by concluding remarks.

Section 1: The Unique Cislunar Domain Environment
Understanding the distinct characteristics of the cislunar environment is fundamental to appreciating the challenges and requirements for effective SSA. This domain differs significantly from the near-Earth regions where current SSA practices were developed.

1.1 Defining Cislunar Space: Scale, Boundaries, and Strategic Importance
Definitions: While various definitions exist, cislunar space is generally understood as the region of space beyond Earth's geosynchronous orbit (GEO) that is primarily influenced by the gravitational fields of both the Earth and the Moon.1 This includes the Earth-Moon Lagrange point regions and trajectories utilizing them.1 Some definitions, like that in the 2022 US National Cislunar Science & Technology Strategy (NCSTS), explicitly include the lunar surface, while excluding the volume below GEO where Earth's gravity dominates.1 NASA definitions sometimes encompass the volume extending from Earth's surface to beyond the Earth-Moon L2 Lagrange point.1 Within the national security community, the term "xGEO" (beyond GEO) is often used synonymously.10 For the purposes of this report, "cislunar" refers to the region beyond GEO within the Earth-Moon system's gravitational influence, including the Lagrange points and lunar vicinity, aligning with the common operational understanding.8

Vast Scale: Cislunar space represents an enormous volume, estimated to be over 1,000 times larger than the volume of space below GEO.1 The average Earth-Moon distance is approximately 384,000 km.3 The strategically important L2 Lagrange point lies roughly 61,350 km beyond the Moon, placing it about 445,000 km from Earth.3 This immense scale has profound implications for SSA. Sensors must detect potentially small, faint objects over distances an order of magnitude greater than those typical for GEO surveillance.33 Achieving adequate sensor coverage across this vast three-dimensional volume presents a significant architectural challenge.1

Strategic Importance: The escalating interest in cislunar space stems from its convergence of scientific, exploratory, commercial, and security interests.1 Scientifically, the Moon and cislunar space offer unique platforms for planetary science, astrophysics, heliophysics, and fundamental physics research.1 It serves as a laboratory for advancing trajectory planning, navigation, and control techniques.1 Exploration initiatives, spearheaded by NASA's Artemis program and the international Gateway space station, view cislunar space as a critical stepping stone for sustained lunar presence and future missions to Mars.1 Commercial entities are drawn by the potential for lunar resource extraction (e.g., water ice confirmed in 2018) and the development of a cislunar economy.1 From a national security perspective, ensuring freedom of navigation and access through cislunar space is vital for protecting terrestrial and space-based assets, securing future access to the Moon, and maintaining strategic stability.1 The US Space Force (USSF), for instance, recognizes its expanding sphere of interest into this domain, necessitating enhanced SDA capabilities.6

1.2 Complex Gravitational Dynamics: Earth-Moon System, Lagrange Points, CR3BP Implications
The defining characteristic of the cislunar environment from a dynamics perspective is the comparable gravitational influence of both the Earth and the Moon.1 This contrasts sharply with near-Earth orbits (LEO, MEO, GEO) where Earth's gravity is overwhelmingly dominant, and motion can be adequately modeled using the two-body problem with perturbations.6

Dominant Physics: Accurate modeling of trajectories in cislunar space necessitates employing multi-body dynamics, most commonly the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP).11 The CR3BP models the motion of a third body (e.g., a spacecraft) with negligible mass under the influence of two primary masses (Earth and Moon) orbiting their common barycenter in circular paths.18 While a powerful simplification, the CR3BP has limitations (e.g., assumes circular orbits for Earth/Moon, treats bodies as point masses). For higher fidelity analysis, more complex models like the Elliptical Restricted Three-Body Problem (ER3BP), the Bicircular Restricted Four-Body Problem (BCR4BP, adding the Sun's influence), or full N-body simulations are required.24

Lagrange Points: A key feature of the CR3BP is the existence of five equilibrium points, known as Lagrange (or libration) points (L1-L5), where the gravitational forces of the Earth and Moon, combined with the centrifugal force in the rotating frame, balance.1 L1 lies between Earth and Moon, L2 lies beyond the Moon, L3 lies opposite the Moon relative to Earth, L4 leads the Moon in its orbit, and L5 trails it.3 The collinear points (L1, L2, L3) are dynamically unstable, meaning spacecraft require periodic station-keeping maneuvers to remain near them.3 The triangular points (L4, L5) are stable under certain mass ratio conditions, including the Earth-Moon system.3 These points, particularly the unstable ones, offer unique locations for missions, requiring minimal energy to maintain position or transfer onto other trajectories.3 The Gateway space station, for example, is planned for a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) near the Earth-Moon L2 point.4 L4/L5 are also considered for observation platforms.41

Unique Orbits: The CR3BP framework gives rise to a rich variety of non-Keplerian periodic and quasi-periodic orbits that do not exist in the simple two-body problem. These include families of Lyapunov orbits (planar orbits near collinear points), Halo orbits (three-dimensional orbits near collinear points), Distant Retrograde Orbits (DROs, stable orbits far from the Moon), Butterfly orbits, Vertical orbits, and resonant orbits.1 These orbits are often dynamically unstable and exhibit complex geometries.11 Associated with unstable periodic orbits are stable and unstable manifolds – paths in phase space along which trajectories naturally approach or depart the periodic orbit.22 These manifolds are crucial for designing low-energy transfers within cislunar space.22

Chaotic Behavior: A critical consequence of the multi-body dynamics is the prevalence of chaos.14 This means that the long-term evolution of trajectories can be extremely sensitive to small changes in initial conditions (position and velocity) or minor perturbations.12 This inherent unpredictability poses a fundamental challenge for long-term orbit prediction, track custody, and collision risk assessment in the SSA context.

The complex, often chaotic, gravitational dynamics governed by the CR3BP and higher-fidelity models are the foundational reason why cislunar SSA is so challenging. These dynamics directly lead to difficulties in predicting object trajectories accurately over operationally relevant timescales. Small errors in initial state determination, which are unavoidable due to sensor limitations and sparse data, can amplify rapidly, leading to large uncertainties in future positions. This sensitivity is the root cause of the prediction problem. The vast scale of the cislunar domain then compounds this issue by making the initial detection and tracking required to get that state estimate extremely difficult due to faint signals and the need for widespread sensor coverage.14 Therefore, addressing cislunar SSA requires tackling both the dynamical complexity through advanced algorithms and the scale/distance problem through enhanced sensor capabilities and architectures.

1.3 Radiation and Other Environmental Factors
Beyond gravity, other environmental factors influence operations and SSA in cislunar space.

Radiation Environment: Operating beyond the protective shield of Earth's magnetosphere exposes spacecraft and personnel to the harsh deep space radiation environment.4 This environment is primarily characterized by two components: continuously present Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs), which are high-energy particles originating from outside the solar system, and sporadic Solar Particle Events (SPEs), which are bursts of lower-energy particles associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections.56 This radiation poses significant risks, necessitating robust shielding for spacecraft systems and habitats.57 Sensors, particularly sensitive optical detectors and focal plane arrays, can degrade over time due to radiation exposure, impacting SSA performance and lifespan.58 Understanding and mitigating radiation effects is crucial for long-duration missions like Gateway, whose initial science payloads (ERSA, HERMES, IDA) are specifically designed to study the heliophysics and radiation environment in its NRHO.4

Lunar Environment: The environment near the Moon also presents unique factors. The Moon possesses irregularly distributed mass concentrations (mascons) beneath its surface, creating a non-uniform gravitational field that perturbs orbits, particularly Low Lunar Orbits (LLOs), requiring frequent station-keeping adjustments.3 The lack of a substantial lunar atmosphere, while enabling very low orbits, also means there is no protection from direct solar illumination or the deep cold of shadow, leading to extreme temperature variations and challenging lighting conditions for optical sensors.3

Section 2: Fundamental Challenges for Cislunar SSA
Building upon the unique environmental characteristics, several fundamental challenges impede the establishment of comprehensive and accurate SSA in the cislunar domain. These challenges stem directly from the vast distances, complex dynamics, and resulting observational constraints.

2.1 Detecting Faint Objects Across Vast Distances
The sheer scale of cislunar space presents a primary obstacle: detecting objects that appear extremely faint from the perspective of available sensors.

Signal Attenuation: The intensity of signals received by sensors diminishes rapidly with distance. For optical and infrared sensors relying on reflected sunlight or thermal emission, the signal strength decreases with the inverse square of the distance (R−2).33 For active sensors like radar or lidar, which rely on transmitting a signal and receiving its reflection, the signal loss is even more severe, following an inverse fourth power law (R−4).49 Given that cislunar objects can be hundreds of thousands of kilometers away, often more than ten times the distance to GEO, the received signals are inherently weak.3

Small/Dim Targets: Compounding the distance issue is the nature of potential targets. While cooperative spacecraft might be relatively large or reflective, SSA must also contend with detecting smaller debris fragments, defunct satellites, or potentially non-cooperative objects with low radar cross-sections or optical reflectivity.11 Detecting such targets at extreme ranges pushes the boundaries of current sensor technology. For context, the capable GEODSS optical system can track basketball-sized objects at roughly 32,000 km (20,000 miles), while the high-resolution HUSIR radar is characterized for detecting millimeter-sized debris below 1000 km.62 Cislunar SSA may require detecting meter-class or smaller objects at ranges exceeding 300,000 km.49

Sensor Sensitivity Limits: Consequently, existing sensor systems, particularly ground-based telescopes and radars designed primarily for LEO/GEO surveillance, often lack the sensitivity required for comprehensive cislunar detection.6 Achieving reliable detection of faint objects across the vast cislunar volume necessitates significant improvements in sensor sensitivity or novel detection strategies.

2.2 Predicting Complex and Chaotic Orbits
Even if an object is detected, predicting its future position accurately presents a major hurdle due to the complex gravitational dynamics.

Non-Keplerian Motion: As established in Section 1.2, the gravitational influences of both the Earth and Moon dominate cislunar dynamics, rendering standard two-body (Keplerian) orbit propagation models inadequate for accurate long-term prediction.11 Predictions based on these simpler models diverge rapidly from the true trajectory.

Sensitivity to Initial Conditions: The chaotic nature inherent in the CR3BP and higher-fidelity models means that even small errors in the initial state estimate (position and velocity derived from sensor measurements) amplify exponentially over time.12 This rapid growth of uncertainty makes it extremely difficult to maintain track custody (knowing where an object will be for the next observation) and significantly complicates the assessment of collision risk, as the predicted positions become highly uncertain.

Maneuver Effects: The sensitivity of cislunar dynamics also means that relatively small propulsive maneuvers, such as those used for routine station-keeping or trajectory adjustments, can induce significant deviations from the predicted ballistic trajectory.18 Detecting these maneuvers promptly is crucial for maintaining accurate tracks, but the inherent prediction errors in the chaotic environment make it challenging to distinguish a genuine maneuver from model inaccuracies or noise, especially with limited data.

2.3 Achieving Sufficient Sensor Coverage and Overcoming Observation Constraints
Effective SSA requires not only detecting and predicting objects but also observing them frequently enough and from suitable locations to maintain awareness.

Geographic Limitations: Ground-based sensor networks, like the US Space Surveillance Network (SSN), have significant geographic gaps, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, South America, Africa, and Asia.58 These gaps limit the ability to continuously monitor objects as they traverse different parts of their cislunar orbits.

Environmental Constraints: Ground-based optical telescopes, a primary tool for deep-space tracking, are constrained by weather conditions (clouds) and the need for nighttime operation.58 Both ground- and space-based optical sensors are affected by exclusion zones where observations are impossible due to the brightness of the Sun or the Moon (lunar glare, sometimes termed the "cone of shame").9 Atmospheric turbulence and scattering can also degrade ground-based observations.59

Sparse Data Acquisition: The combination of the vast volume to be searched, the limited number and sensitivity of suitable sensors, geographic gaps, and environmental constraints inevitably leads to sparse data acquisition.9 This means observations are often infrequent, tracklets (sequences of observations) are short, and data may only be available from a single sensor type (e.g., angles-only from optical telescopes).12 Sparse data severely complicates the process of initial orbit determination (IOD) – figuring out an object's orbit from limited observations – and exacerbates the uncertainty growth during prediction between observations.

Sensor Tasking Complexity: Optimally scheduling and tasking the limited available sensor resources (especially narrow field-of-view telescopes or radars) to effectively search the vast cislunar volume, acquire newly detected objects, and maintain tracks on known objects is a complex optimization problem.11 Efficient tasking is crucial for maximizing the utility of the sensor network.

These fundamental challenges – detecting faint objects, predicting complex motion, and achieving adequate coverage – are not independent issues but are deeply interconnected. The difficulty in detecting faint objects naturally leads to sparser data, as fewer sensors can successfully observe a target, and observations may only occur under ideal conditions.9 This resulting data sparsity, in turn, significantly compounds the difficulty of orbit determination and prediction within the complex, chaotic cislunar dynamics, leading to larger initial uncertainties and faster error growth.12 Furthermore, limitations in sensor coverage due to geography or environmental factors directly contribute to data sparsity by restricting observation opportunities.58 Finally, the inherent difficulty in prediction makes reacquiring objects after observation gaps more challenging, impacting the effective coverage and detection rates in subsequent attempts. Therefore, a successful cislunar SSA strategy cannot focus on just one challenge in isolation; it must address detection sensitivity, prediction accuracy (especially with sparse data), and coverage limitations concurrently through a combination of improved sensors, advanced algorithms, and optimized architectures.

Section 3: Evaluating Sensor Capabilities for Cislunar SSA
Addressing the challenges outlined requires a critical evaluation of the sensor technologies available or under development for cislunar SSA. This involves understanding the capabilities and limitations of current ground-based systems, assessing the potential of space-based assets, and exploring emerging sensor concepts.

3.1 Current Ground-Based Systems: Capabilities and Limitations
Ground-based sensors form the historical backbone of SSA, but their applicability to the cislunar domain faces significant hurdles.

Optical Telescopes (e.g., GEODSS, SST):

Capabilities: Ground-based optical telescopes are the traditional workhorse for detecting and tracking objects beyond LEO, including those in MEO, GEO, HEO, and extending towards cislunar space.59 Systems like the Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) network utilize meter-class telescopes equipped with sensitive digital cameras (e.g., Deep STARE technology).62 These systems can detect objects significantly fainter than the human eye can perceive; GEODSS is cited as being able to track objects as small as a basketball at distances over 20,000 miles (approx. 32,000 km) under good conditions.62 Optical systems can survey relatively large areas of the sky compared to narrow-beam radars.61 They are also generally less expensive to build and maintain than large radar systems, and upgrades (like camera improvements for GEODSS) are feasible.58
Limitations: The primary limitations are environmental and range-related. Optical telescopes require clear, dark skies for operation, making them susceptible to weather (clouds) and unusable during daylight hours.58 Atmospheric turbulence and absorption also degrade image quality and limit sensitivity.59 The fixed geographic locations of ground sites lead to incomplete global coverage, particularly lacking in the Southern Hemisphere.58 Significant portions of the sky are periodically unusable due to exclusion zones around the bright Sun and Moon.9 Most critically for cislunar SSA, the inverse-square law dictates a significant drop in sensitivity at the extreme distances involved, making the detection of faint or small objects challenging.11 Furthermore, traditional astrometric accuracy requirements (e.g., <5 arcseconds for SSN contributing sensors) may need reassessment, as a fixed angular error translates to a much larger positional error at cislunar distances.58
Radar Systems (e.g., Space Fence, Millstone/HUSIR):

Capabilities: Radars are the primary sensors for LEO SSA due to their ability to operate 24/7, regardless of weather or lighting conditions.59 They can directly measure range and range-rate (Doppler shift), providing valuable 3D information.61 Phased-array radars like the S-band Space Fence can detect and track large numbers of objects simultaneously, with high sensitivity in LEO (down to marble-sized objects).61 High-power, large-aperture radars like the Millstone Hill Radar (L-band) and the Haystack Ultrawideband Satellite Imaging Radar (HUSIR, X/W-band) provide deep-space tracking and high-resolution imaging capabilities, contributing valuable data on debris and satellite characteristics.63 HUSIR, for instance, is used by NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office to characterize debris down to ~5 mm below 1000 km altitude.65 Some ground-based planetary radars also hold potential for cislunar object detection.71
Limitations: The fundamental limitation for radar in cislunar SSA is the R−4 signal attenuation.49 Detecting small or distant objects in cislunar space requires immense transmitter power and extremely large antennas, making dedicated cislunar surveillance radars prohibitively expensive and energy-intensive.59 Current powerful systems like Space Fence are optimized for LEO and lack the range and sensitivity for comprehensive cislunar coverage.61 While systems like Millstone and HUSIR contribute to deep-space tracking, their primary operational envelope is typically below or near GEO, and their sensitivity is insufficient for detecting faint objects across the entire cislunar volume.63
Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Ground-Based Sensor Modalities for Cislunar SSA

Feature	Optical Telescope (e.g., GEODSS)	Tracking Radar (e.g., Millstone)	Surveillance Radar (e.g., Space Fence)
Primary Regime	GEO / Deep Space	LEO / MEO / Deep Space	LEO
Cislunar Strengths	Best range potential (R⁻²)	All-weather, Range measurement	All-weather, Multi-target (in LEO)
Cislunar Weaknesses	Weather/daylight dependent, Atmospheric effects, Moon/Sun exclusion, Significant sensitivity loss at range	Extreme power needs, R⁻⁴ loss, Limited range/sensitivity for small/distant objects	R⁻⁴ loss, Primarily LEO focus, Extreme power/cost for cislunar scale
Maintenance/Cost	Lower cost, Easier maintenance	High cost, High power	Very high cost, Very high power
This comparison highlights that while optical telescopes offer the best potential range due to the R−2 signal falloff, they face significant operational constraints. Radars overcome these constraints but suffer from severe signal attenuation (R−4), limiting their practical reach for faint cislunar objects without massive investment. This underscores the inherent limitations of relying solely on ground-based assets for comprehensive cislunar SSA and motivates the exploration of space-based solutions.

3.2 Existing and Planned Space-Based Assets: Current Gaps and Future Potential
Space-based sensors offer potential advantages for cislunar SSA by overcoming terrestrial limitations, but dedicated capabilities are currently lacking.

Current Assets (Limited Cislunar Focus): The US operates space-based SSA assets like the Space-Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) optical satellite and the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) constellation, which provides close-up inspection capabilities in GEO.61 Canada contributes the Sapphire optical sensor.61 However, these systems are primarily focused on the LEO and GEO regimes and do not provide dedicated, persistent coverage of the broader cislunar volume. A significant gap exists in operational, space-based infrastructure specifically tasked with cislunar SSA.9

NASA Gateway: The planned Gateway space station, to be assembled in a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) around the Moon, represents a major piece of cislunar infrastructure.4 While its primary purpose is supporting Artemis lunar missions and deep space exploration, and its initial science payloads focus on heliophysics and radiation (ERSA, HERMES, IDA), its strategic location and long-duration presence make it a potential future platform for hosting dedicated SSA sensors or facilitating cislunar SDA research.4 Its international nature (with contributions from ESA, JAXA, CSA, MBRSC) also underscores the collaborative aspect of cislunar endeavors.38

Planned Missions: The sheer number of planned missions to cislunar space and Lagrange points by various nations and commercial entities (>130 uncrewed missions projected 2024-2033, plus Lagrange point missions) drastically increases the need for robust SSA.1 While these missions are not primarily for SSA, they could potentially carry hosted SSA payloads or contribute tracking data through cooperative means, forming part of a broader data ecosystem.1

USSF/DoD Initiatives: Recognizing the strategic importance and future operational inevitability of the cislunar domain, the USSF and DoD are actively considering requirements for cislunar SDA.6 The 2020 NASA-USSF Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) explicitly includes collaboration on deep space survey and tracking technologies, cislunar communications and navigation, and establishing operational standards, including conjunction assessment.6 Recent White House directives task the DoD with leading research and development for extending SSA capabilities into cislunar space, including developing new ground- and space-based sensors, potentially utilizing novel orbits, and evaluating commercial and international contributions.40 Early USSF research efforts are exploring concepts for monitoring Lagrange points and providing foundational capabilities like command, control, communications (C3), positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), SDA, and Lunar Surface Awareness (LSA) to support broader cislunar activities.26

Benefits of Space-Based SSA: Placing sensors in space offers distinct advantages for cislunar SSA. It eliminates atmospheric distortion and weather constraints faced by ground optical systems.59 Strategic placement can provide persistent coverage of key regions and overcome geographic limitations of ground networks.27 Observing from closer proximity reduces the range to targets, mitigating sensitivity issues and potentially allowing detection of dimmer or smaller objects.49 Space-based sensors may also have smaller exclusion zones around the Sun and Moon compared to ground sites looking through the atmosphere.58

Challenges of Space-Based SSA: Despite the benefits, deploying space-based SSA systems presents significant challenges. The cost of designing, building, launching, operating, and eventually replenishing space assets is substantially higher than for ground systems.58 On-orbit maintenance and upgrades are generally difficult or impossible.58 Spacecraft face power constraints, which is particularly limiting for energy-intensive active sensors like radar.59 Data downlink bandwidth can also be a bottleneck, potentially delaying the transmission of large volumes of sensor data to the ground.58 Furthermore, the space environment itself poses risks, including sensor degradation from radiation and potential damage from micrometeoroid or orbital debris impacts.4

3.3 Emerging Sensor Technologies and Novel Observation Concepts
Given the limitations of current ground and space assets, significant research and development are focused on emerging technologies and novel concepts specifically tailored for the demands of cislunar SSA.

Dedicated Cislunar Sensors: A key area of exploration involves designing sensors explicitly for the cislunar environment and deploying them in strategically advantageous locations. Concepts include placing optical or other sensors in stable or quasi-stable orbits such as Earth-Moon Lagrange Point Orbits (LPOs at L1, L2, L4, L5), Distant Retrograde Orbits (DROs), Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs), or specialized Cislunar Periodic Orbits (CPOs) that may traverse large regions of space.8 Studies analyze the effectiveness of these orbits for monitoring specific target populations, like objects in NRHOs similar to Gateway.8 Concepts like "Pole-Sitter" orbits, offering persistent views of polar regions, are also being investigated.71 Lunar-based sensors are another possibility being explored for their unique vantage point.71

Distributed Sensor Networks: Rather than relying on a few large, exquisite sensors, many emerging concepts envision networks of smaller, potentially less expensive sensors distributed across ground and space.9 These sensors would communicate and coordinate their observations, potentially fusing data from heterogeneous sources (optical, radar, RF) to build a more complete and resilient SSA picture.81 Such networks could offer better coverage, increased revisit rates, and greater robustness against the failure of individual nodes.

Novel Observation Techniques: Research presented at forums like the Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) Conference highlights innovative techniques:

Interferometry: Utilizing formations of small satellites, potentially near Lagrange points, to perform optical interferometry, enabling high-resolution imaging and characterization of distant cislunar objects.31
Advanced Optical/Imaging: Techniques beyond standard photometry and astrometry are being explored, including shadow imaging (observing objects as they occult background sources), hyperspectral thermal imaging for material identification or activity monitoring, temporal differential spectrophotometry to detect changes, high-speed event-based sensors that only report pixel changes, photon-counting detectors for ultimate low-light sensitivity, and advanced image processing like speckle interferometry exploitation (e.g., AFRL's SpeckleNet) to enhance resolution.49
Passive RF Sensing: Exploiting the radio frequency (RF) signals emitted by active satellites offers a complementary sensing modality. Techniques involve detecting, characterizing, and geolocating RF signals to identify satellites, monitor their activity (e.g., communication patterns), potentially perform RF fingerprinting for unique identification, and possibly detect maneuvers based on Doppler shifts or changes in communication behavior.82 This can augment traditional optical/radar tracking, especially for active satellites.83
Laser-based Techniques: Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) can provide highly accurate range measurements, potentially applicable to cooperative cislunar targets.69 More speculative concepts include using lasers for remote maneuvering of debris.69
Non-Traditional Sensors: Leveraging data from sensors not primarily designed for SSA, such as astronomical observatories (e.g., JWST) or planetary science radars, can provide opportunistic data.71 Developing hybrid sensors capable of multiple sensing modalities (e.g., combined SDA and lunar surface intelligence) is also being considered.71
Enhanced Sensor Sensitivity: A cross-cutting theme is the push for greater sensitivity to detect faint cislunar objects. This involves both hardware advancements, such as developing more sensitive detectors (e.g., photon-counting detectors operating in the visible/near-IR 49), and sophisticated software processing techniques. Algorithms are being developed to detect faint, slow-moving targets in noisy image sequences, often adapting methods from asteroid detection.12 Machine learning, particularly deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), are being applied to detect objects in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) images, potentially enabling detection closer to the bright Moon.50 Efforts are also underway to adapt existing ground-based optical systems through optimized observing procedures and processing pipelines specifically for cislunar tracking and discovery.33

AFRL/AMOS Contributions: The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the AMOS Conference serve as significant focal points for advancing these emerging technologies. AFRL sponsors research, develops concepts (like SSPIDR space-based solar power, which has SDA implications), operates key facilities (like the AMOS site itself), and collaborates on strategic initiatives related to cislunar SDA.71 The annual AMOS conference provides a premier technical forum for presenting and discussing cutting-edge research in cislunar SSA, sensor development, algorithms, data processing, and policy, with numerous contributions from AFRL, academia, and industry.70

The development and integration of these emerging technologies hold the potential to fundamentally alter the feasibility and economics of robust cislunar SSA. Traditional approaches relying on a small number of large, expensive ground- or space-based sensors face inherent limitations in coverage, sensitivity, cost, and resilience when scaled to the cislunar domain.33 Distributed networks of potentially smaller, more numerous sensors can offer improved geographic coverage, higher revisit rates, and greater system resilience at potentially lower overall cost.9 Advanced processing techniques, particularly those leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, can extract more meaningful information from the noisy, sparse data likely to be generated by less capable or non-traditional sensors, maximizing the value of collected data.12 Furthermore, incorporating novel sensing modalities like passive RF or interferometry provides complementary information that can overcome the limitations of optical or radar sensors alone.31 The synergy between distributed architectures, advanced algorithms, and diverse sensing techniques represents a crucial enabling pathway toward achieving the comprehensive and persistent cislunar SSA required for future operations, potentially overcoming the limitations that make traditional monolithic approaches impractical or unaffordable for this challenging domain.

Section 4: Advanced Algorithms and Data Processing for Cislunar SSA
Beyond sensor hardware, the algorithms used to process sensor data, determine orbits, predict future positions, and fuse information are critical components of any SSA system. The unique dynamics and observation challenges of cislunar space demand significant advancements in these algorithmic capabilities.

4.1 Orbit Determination and Prediction in Multi-Body Regimes
Determining and predicting the orbits of cislunar objects from typically sparse and often angles-only sensor data is a core algorithmic challenge.

IOD Challenges: Initial Orbit Determination (IOD) – the process of estimating an object's initial state (position and velocity) from a limited set of observations – is notoriously difficult in the cislunar regime.12 Classical IOD methods developed for the two-body problem (e.g., Laplace, Gauss, Gooding) often perform poorly or fail entirely when applied to the non-Keplerian dynamics of the CR3BP, especially with sparse data or angles-only measurements.12 The highly nonlinear and sometimes chaotic nature of the dynamics means that solutions are very sensitive to the initial guess, and convergence is not guaranteed.12 The lack of readily available range information in angles-only scenarios further complicates the problem.12

Advanced IOD Algorithms: Significant research focuses on developing IOD algorithms tailored for cislunar dynamics and data limitations:

Advanced Filtering Techniques: Methods based on nonlinear filtering, such as Particle Filters and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) filters (including variants like Ensemble GMM (EnGMF) and Adaptive Entropy-based GMM Information Synthesis (AEGIS)), are being adapted for cislunar IOD.12 These filters can represent non-Gaussian probability distributions that arise from nonlinear dynamics and sparse measurements. They often incorporate concepts like Probabilistic Admissible Regions (PARs) to constrain the initial search space based on measurement geometry or dynamical constraints.12 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are also used to generate accurate non-Gaussian representations of the state distribution from tracklets.67
Collocation Methods: Direct collocation techniques represent a fundamentally different approach.43 Instead of propagating an initial state forward in time using numerical integration (as in shooting methods), collocation discretizes the entire trajectory over a set of nodes and solves for the state at each node simultaneously, subject to constraints imposed by the equations of motion and the measurements. This approach has demonstrated significant advantages for cislunar IOD, including a larger region of convergence (less sensitivity to the initial guess), improved stability over long observation arcs (hours to days), and the ability to handle sparse data effectively.43 Sparse grid collocation is one variant.43 Solvers like SNOPT (Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer) are often used to solve the resulting large-scale optimization problem.51 Collocation can also be formulated to simultaneously determine a periodic orbit and its period from measurements.43
Machine Learning (ML) Approaches: ML, particularly Neural Networks (NNs), offers another promising avenue.12 NNs can be trained on large datasets of simulated cislunar orbits and observations to learn the complex mapping from measurements (e.g., angles-only) to orbital states or parameters. Approaches include:
Direct regression NNs to estimate the 6D state.12
Classification NNs to identify the likely orbit family (e.g., L1 Halo, DRO).12
Hybrid models combining classification and regression.12
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that incorporate the governing dynamical equations (e.g., CR3BP) directly into the NN loss function, aiming to ensure physically consistent solutions.79 Techniques like transfer learning can improve PINN training stability and speed.79
The MCCLOD (Machine Classifier for Cislunar Orbit Determination) model specifically uses NNs trained on CRTBP periodic orbit families to map angles and angular rates to orbit parameters.12
Other Techniques: Methods like dynamic triangulation (using sequential line-of-sight measurements) 64 and reformulating IOD as an optimization problem 12 are also under investigation.
Orbit Prediction & Uncertainty Propagation: Accurately predicting the future state and quantifying the associated uncertainty is crucial for SSA tasks like sensor tasking and conjunction assessment. This is particularly challenging in cislunar space due to the chaotic dynamics causing rapid uncertainty growth and non-Gaussian distributions, especially over the long periods (days to weeks) expected between observations.14 Key approaches include:

State Transition Tensors (STTs): These are higher-order extensions of the standard state transition matrix used in linear covariance propagation. STTs capture higher-order sensitivities to initial conditions, allowing for more accurate propagation of uncertainty distributions, especially when combined with GMM representations.17
Multi-Fidelity Propagation: To manage the computational cost of propagating large ensembles of particles or sigma points needed to represent non-Gaussian uncertainty, multi-fidelity methods are employed.35 These techniques dynamically blend computationally expensive high-fidelity dynamics models (e.g., full N-body or ER3BP) with faster low-fidelity models (e.g., CR3BP or even simpler approximations) using methods like stochastic collocation or adaptive model selection. This aims to achieve sufficient accuracy with significantly reduced computation time.35
Machine Learning for Prediction: ML models, such as Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), can be trained to rapidly predict long-term orbital stability or lifetime based on initial orbital elements or limited observational data, providing quick characterization useful for large surveys or early warning.14
Low-Complexity Algorithms (LCA): Research explores interpolation-based algorithms (e.g., using Hermite cubic splines) that aim to predict trajectories between known state measurements with reduced computational complexity compared to full numerical integration.15 However, their sensitivity to noise and uncertainty in the input measurements requires careful analysis.15
4.2 Data Fusion, Integration, and Information Sharing Architectures
Individual sensors provide only a partial view of the cislunar domain. Combining data from multiple, diverse sources through data fusion and robust information sharing architectures is essential for building a comprehensive operational picture.

Need for Fusion: Data fusion techniques combine data from multiple sensors (potentially heterogeneous, e.g., optical, radar, passive RF) and sources (ground-based, space-based, commercial, international) to achieve improved accuracy, completeness, robustness, and timeliness compared to relying on single sources.61 Fusion leverages the complementary strengths of different sensor types (e.g., optical for angles, radar for range, RF for activity) and mitigates individual weaknesses (e.g., weather dependence of optical sensors).81

Fusion Levels: Fusion can occur at different levels of abstraction 81:

Data-Level (Low-Level): Combining raw sensor measurements before feature extraction. This can potentially yield the most informative result but requires compatible, well-calibrated data streams.81
Feature-Level (Mid-Level): Fusing features extracted from sensor data (e.g., lines, edges from images; time/frequency of arrival from RF signals).81 This is common for tasks like object recognition or state estimation.81
Decision-Level (High-Level): Combining the outputs or decisions made by individual sensors or algorithms (e.g., object detections, track states, classifications).81 This is often simpler to implement with heterogeneous systems but may involve some information loss.81 SSA applications often involve feature-level fusion (e.g., combining different measurement types in an orbit determination filter) and decision-level fusion (e.g., correlating tracks from different sensors).84
Fusion Techniques: A variety of algorithms can be employed for data fusion, depending on the data types and fusion level. These include statistical methods like Kalman filters (Extended, Unscented, Cubature) and their variants for state estimation and track fusion, Bayesian inference, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means), and increasingly, machine learning and AI techniques.81 For multi-target tracking (MTT) scenarios, techniques like Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) and Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) are used to handle the assignment of measurements to tracks, especially in dense or ambiguous situations.35

Unified Data Library (UDL): The US Space Force's Unified Data Library (UDL) represents a key architectural component aimed at facilitating data fusion and access.66 It is designed as a cloud-based data repository to ingest, consolidate, process, and manage SSA data from a wide variety of sources, including US government sensors (like Space Fence, with which it has established direct connection 99), commercial SSA providers (via contracts with companies like Bluestaq 97), and potentially international partners.66 The stated goal is for the UDL to serve as the single, authoritative source for accessing all data supporting Space Force operational systems, thereby breaking down traditional data stovepipes.66

UDL Challenges & Evolution: Despite its goals, the UDL has faced significant challenges hindering its operational utility. GAO reports and strategic plans have highlighted issues including a lack of integration with existing operational SSA systems used by guardians, difficulties incorporating commercial data effectively, concerns about data timeliness, and the absence of a single data standard.66 In response, the Space Force's FY25 Data & AI Strategic Action Plan outlines a multi-pronged effort to overhaul the UDL.96 Key actions include transitioning the UDL from a prototype to a formal Program of Record using the agile Software Acquisition Pathway, establishing formal requirements and an Application Programming Interface (API) gateway, integrating data from critical government sensors (like SDA constellations), and crucially, integrating the UDL with operational systems used by Space Operations Squadrons (SOPS).96

International Collaboration & Standards: Given the global nature of space activity, effective cislunar SSA necessitates international collaboration and data sharing.7 The US is actively engaged with partners like ESA, JAXA, and CSA through initiatives like Gateway.1 The NASA-USSF MOU also emphasizes establishing standards and best practices for safe operations, including SSA sharing and conjunction assessment.6 However, effective data fusion and interoperability depend critically on the adoption of common data standards, formats, quality metrics, and secure sharing protocols.28 Developing and promoting these standards is a crucial step for enabling a truly global and collaborative SSA ecosystem.

While the development of sophisticated algorithms for orbit determination, prediction, and uncertainty propagation is undeniably critical for tackling the complexities of cislunar dynamics, the ultimate performance of these algorithms is fundamentally constrained by the data they receive. The quality (accuracy, uncertainty characterization), quantity (number of observations, tracklet length), timeliness, and accessibility of sensor data form the bedrock upon which these algorithms operate.12 Even the most advanced filter or predictor will produce unreliable results if fed sparse, noisy, or excessively delayed measurements. Therefore, progress in data fusion techniques, which aim to enhance data quality and completeness by combining multiple sources 81, and the development of robust data integration architectures, such as a fully functional and accessible UDL 66, are just as vital as algorithmic innovation. Addressing potential bottlenecks in data acquisition, processing pipelines, standardization, and sharing policies 28 is a critical co-requisite for realizing the full potential of advanced algorithms and achieving truly effective cislunar SSA. Data management and infrastructure must be treated as first-order priorities alongside sensor and algorithm development.

Section 5: Enhancing Short-Term Cislunar Monitoring Effectiveness
A primary objective of robust SSA is to support timely and effective short-term monitoring tasks, ensuring the safety and predictability of space operations. In the cislunar context, two particularly crucial tasks are Conjunction Assessment (CA) and maneuver detection. Improved SSA capabilities directly enhance performance in both areas.

5.1 Conjunction Assessment (CA) in the Cislunar Environment: Challenges and Methods
Conjunction Assessment is the process of predicting close approaches between orbiting objects and evaluating the associated collision risk.101 As cislunar space becomes more populated, particularly in desirable regions like NRHOs or near Lagrange points, the need for reliable CA will grow significantly.11

Unique CA Challenges: Performing CA in the cislunar regime presents unique difficulties beyond those encountered in LEO/GEO:

Non-linear Uncertainty Propagation: The chaotic dynamics inherent in the CR3BP cause uncertainties in object states to grow rapidly and often non-linearly (non-Gaussianly).17 Standard CA methods often rely on linear propagation of Gaussian covariance matrices to estimate the Probability of Collision (Pc), which may be inaccurate or overly conservative in this environment.17
Sparse Data Impacts: Infrequent observations lead to larger state uncertainties at the time of prediction, particularly over the multi-day prediction horizons often needed for CA planning.17 Larger uncertainties inherently make collision risk assessment less precise and can lead to higher false alarm rates or missed detections.
Complex Encounter Geometries: Close approaches in multi-body regimes can involve different relative velocity vectors and encounter dynamics compared to the more predictable Keplerian encounters common in near-Earth orbits.
CA Methodologies: Existing and developing CA methods aim to address these challenges:

Operational Processes (NASA CARA / JPL MADCAP): NASA's Conjunction Assessment Risk Analysis (CARA) team provides operational CA for NASA's uncrewed missions, building on processes originally developed for Human Space Flight (HSF).101 JPL's Multi-mission Automated Deep-space Conjunction Assessment Process (MADCAP) is specifically used for deep-space environments, including Mars, the Moon, and Sun/Earth libration points.103 These processes involve screening trajectories against catalogs, processing tracking data (ephemeris and covariance), calculating risk metrics (e.g., close approach distance (CAD), orbit crossing distance (OXD), orbit crossing timing (OXT), and Pc), and coordinating with mission operators for potential collision avoidance maneuvers.101 MADCAP relies on trajectory inputs provided by navigation teams, preferably with formal covariance data, but can approximate uncertainty if needed.103 Both CARA and MADCAP face challenges adapting to the increasing number of objects, new sensor data (like Space Fence), and the rise of large constellations with autonomous maneuvering capabilities.101
Advanced Pc Calculation for Non-Gaussian Uncertainty: To handle the non-linear uncertainty propagation, advanced methods are being developed. One approach involves representing the state uncertainty of each object as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).17 The GMM components can then be propagated more accurately using higher-order methods like State Transition Tensors (STTs).17 The collision probability between the two resulting GMM distributions at the time of closest approach can then be calculated using analytical formulas (like adaptations of Foster's method) that sum the contributions from interactions between all pairs of Gaussian components from the two objects.17 These semi-analytical methods offer significant computational speed advantages over pure Monte Carlo simulations while capturing the essential non-linear effects.17
Dynamical Model Fidelity: Accurate CA relies on using appropriate dynamical models for propagation. Studies suggest that the CR3BP provides a reasonable balance of accuracy and computational cost for propagating uncertainty over relevant timescales in cislunar space, though higher-fidelity models may be needed for specific high-accuracy requirements.46
Impact of SSA Accuracy: The quality of the underlying SSA data is fundamental to the reliability of CA. Improvements in state estimation accuracy (reducing the mean error) and uncertainty characterization (providing more realistic covariance or probability distributions) directly translate to more accurate Pc calculations and miss distance predictions.17 Better SSA reduces the volume of uncertainty around predicted positions, leading to fewer unnecessary warnings (false alarms) and increased confidence when an avoidance maneuver is deemed necessary. This allows for more efficient use of propellant and reduces operational disruption.101

5.2 Maneuver Detection Techniques for Complex Dynamics
Detecting when a spacecraft performs a propulsive maneuver is another critical short-term monitoring task, essential for maintaining track custody and understanding object behavior (SDA).

Critical Need: Maneuver detection is arguably even more critical in cislunar space than near Earth.19 Due to the sensitivity of the dynamics, even very small maneuvers (e.g., millimetric or centimeter-per-second delta-Vs used for station-keeping in halo or NRHO orbits) can cause the spacecraft's actual trajectory to diverge significantly from its predicted ballistic path over short periods.18 Failure to detect and account for these maneuvers quickly can lead to loss of track, especially given sparse observation opportunities.19 Detecting maneuvers on non-cooperative objects is also a key element of SDA, helping to infer intent or capability.19

Detection Challenges: Detecting maneuvers in this environment is challenging.19 Small thrusts may produce subtle changes in the observed motion that are difficult to distinguish from the inherent prediction errors caused by chaotic dynamics, unmodeled forces (like solar radiation pressure), or measurement noise, particularly when data is sparse.19 Traditional methods relying on detecting statistically significant deviations in measurement residuals may struggle when the baseline prediction uncertainty is already large and non-Gaussian.

Detection Algorithms/Methods: Several approaches are being investigated for cislunar maneuver detection:

Optimal Control Based Estimator (OCBE): The OCBE is a filtering technique that explicitly includes an estimated "optimal control" input in its state vector.19 This control term effectively represents the unmodeled accelerations acting on the object. In the absence of maneuvers, this term should statistically resemble noise. When a maneuver occurs, the estimated control profile will show a statistically significant deviation. By analyzing the distribution of this estimated control (e.g., using Monte Carlo simulations to establish baseline noise levels), a binary hypothesis test can be applied to determine if a maneuver has occurred.19 This method has shown promise in simulations using optical measurements from cislunar observers, successfully detecting small impulsive maneuvers.19 Derivations in specialized coordinate systems (like SRI space) can improve numerical stability.55
Advanced Filtering Approaches: Maneuver detection and estimation can be incorporated into the framework of advanced Bayesian filters (like GMM or particle filters). This might involve augmenting the state vector to include maneuver parameters or sampling potential thrust profiles as part of the estimation process.16 Methods using multivariate Laplace distributions for thrust priors and leveraging rare event simulation theory and multi-fidelity propagation have been proposed for tracking maneuvering spacecraft with sparse data.54
Machine Learning/AI: ML techniques could potentially be applied to detect maneuvers by learning patterns in observational data (e.g., light curves, astrometry, RF signals) that correlate with propulsive events.83 Classifiers could be trained to distinguish between ballistic motion and various types of maneuvers.
Normal Form Coordinates: Specialized coordinate systems derived from dynamical systems theory (normal forms or action-angle variables) can characterize the underlying structure of motion near libration points.21 By parameterizing maneuvers in terms of their effect on these coordinates, it may be possible to define admissible maneuver sets corresponding to specific dynamical outcomes (e.g., lunar flyby) and detect deviations from expected behavior.21 This approach can also help define reachable sets after potential maneuvers, aiding in the search for lost objects.21
Relative Optical Measurements: When two spacecraft are observing each other, relative optical measurements can be used within an estimation framework (like spacecraft-to-spacecraft absolute tracking) combined with OCBE to simultaneously estimate the absolute states of both vehicles and classify maneuvers performed by the target craft.104
5.3 Quantifying the Impact of SSA Accuracy on Monitoring Performance
There is a direct and quantifiable link between the fundamental accuracy of the SSA system and its ability to effectively support short-term monitoring tasks like CA and maneuver detection.

Direct Link: Improvements in core SSA functions – including better sensor sensitivity (detecting objects earlier and more reliably), higher tracking accuracy (more precise state estimates), enhanced prediction fidelity (more accurate propagation of states and uncertainties), and more robust uncertainty quantification (realistic non-Gaussian distributions) – yield direct benefits for CA and maneuver detection performance.

CA Benefits: More accurate state estimates and better uncertainty characterization lead to smaller, more realistic uncertainty volumes around predicted positions at the time of closest approach.17 This directly improves the reliability of collision probability calculations, reducing the frequency of false alarms (warnings for events that pose no real risk) and increasing confidence in warnings for genuinely high-risk conjunctions.101 This allows operators to make more informed decisions about whether or not to perform costly avoidance maneuvers and enables the setting of more operationally meaningful risk thresholds.101

Maneuver Detection Benefits: Higher fidelity tracking and prediction capabilities reduce the baseline level of error and uncertainty in the estimated trajectory.19 This makes it easier for detection algorithms (like OCBE or residual analysis) to distinguish the signature of a genuine maneuver from background noise or inherent prediction inaccuracies. Improved SSA accuracy therefore leads to faster detection of maneuvers, better estimation of maneuver magnitude and direction, reduced missed detections, and fewer false alarms, all of which contribute to maintaining track custody and enhancing overall space domain awareness.19

Timeliness: Beyond accuracy, the timeliness of the SSA processing chain is critical for short-term monitoring.28 Faster data acquisition, processing (IOD, propagation, screening), and dissemination allow operators to receive warnings and assessments sooner, providing more time to react to potential collisions or unexpected maneuvers. Improvements in algorithmic efficiency (e.g., multi-fidelity propagation, ML-based prediction) and data infrastructure (e.g., optimized data flow within UDL) directly contribute to reducing the latency in the SSA cycle.

The interplay between the chaotic dynamics of cislunar space and the requirements for operational decision-making implies the existence of a minimum performance threshold for SSA systems. The rapid growth of uncertainty inherent in multi-body dynamics means that if initial state estimates are too poor, or if the time between observations is too long, the predicted uncertainty volume can quickly become so large as to render CA results statistically meaningless (i.e., probabilities approach uniform distributions over large volumes) or make it impossible to distinguish maneuvers from the background prediction error.14 Since operational decisions, such as planning and executing a collision avoidance maneuver, require a certain amount of lead time 101, the SSA system must be capable of providing state predictions and associated uncertainties that remain sufficiently accurate and constrained over that required decision timeframe. This defines a minimum threshold for SSA accuracy and timeliness; systems falling below this threshold cannot reliably support effective short-term monitoring in the challenging cislunar environment. Achieving at least this threshold level of performance is therefore a fundamental requirement for enabling safe and predictable operations.

Section 6: Strategies and Requirements for Robust Cislunar SSA
Synthesizing the analysis of the cislunar environment, its challenges, available technologies, and algorithmic needs allows for the formulation of strategies and requirements for establishing a robust and effective SSA capability tailored for this domain.

6.1 Synthesized Performance Requirements for Cislunar SSA Systems
Defining clear performance requirements is essential to guide the development and deployment of cislunar SSA systems. These requirements must address the unique challenges of the domain:

Accuracy: Systems must achieve specified levels of accuracy for state estimation (position and velocity) and prediction over operationally relevant timescales (e.g., hours to multiple days for CA and maneuver detection planning). Requirements should be linked directly to the needs of downstream applications, such as providing sufficiently low uncertainty in collision probability calculations or enabling reliable discrimination between maneuvers and noise. Tiered accuracy requirements might be appropriate, with higher accuracy needed for critical assets or high-interest objects. Traditional angular accuracy metrics (e.g., arcseconds) used in near-Earth SSA need critical re-evaluation for cislunar distances, as the same angular error translates to much larger positional uncertainty; requirements should perhaps be defined in terms of absolute position/velocity uncertainty or metrics relevant to CA (e.g., uncertainty in the conjunction plane).58
Timeliness: Stringent requirements are needed for data latency (time from observation to availability for processing), processing speed (for IOD, orbit propagation, CA screening, maneuver detection), and information dissemination.28 Timeliness is critical to enable effective response to dynamic events like potential collisions or unexpected maneuvers within operationally relevant timelines.
Sensitivity: Minimum detectable object characteristics (e.g., size, visual magnitude, radar cross-section) must be defined for representative cislunar ranges and orbital regimes (e.g., near L1/L2, in NRHOs, in lunar orbit, during transfer).33 This drives sensor design and deployment strategies.
Coverage: Requirements should specify the desired spatial coverage (which key regions like Lagrange points, specific orbit families, or transfer corridors need monitoring) and temporal coverage (minimum revisit rates needed to maintain track custody given the dynamics and expected observation gaps).8
Completeness: The system should aim to detect, track, and catalog as comprehensively as possible the population of objects in cislunar space, including operational satellites, defunct objects, and debris, to provide a full picture of the environment.11
Robustness/Resilience: The overall SSA system should be designed for robustness against single-point failures, sensor outages (due to weather, maintenance, or malfunction), challenging observation conditions (e.g., near the Moon/Sun), and potential adversarial actions.
6.2 Architectural Considerations: Optimizing Sensor Mix and Data Infrastructure
Designing the architecture involves strategic decisions about sensor types, placement, and the underlying data infrastructure.

Hybrid Architecture: A consensus is emerging that a purely ground-based or purely space-based architecture is insufficient. A multi-layered, hybrid approach combining ground-based sensors (leveraging existing assets where possible, potentially with sensitivity upgrades) and strategically deployed space-based sensors appears necessary.26 Ground systems offer easier maintenance and lower lifecycle costs, while space systems provide unique coverage, persistence, and potentially better sensitivity by overcoming atmospheric and geographic limitations.58 The potential for lunar-based sensors adds another layer to consider for specific observation advantages.71
Sensor Placement Strategy: The placement of space-based sensors is critical. Optimal locations might include orbits around Earth-Moon Lagrange points (L1, L2, L4, L5), DROs, NRHOs, or other periodic orbits chosen based on detailed coverage analysis, information gain metrics (quantifying the value of observations from different locations), and the specific populations of cislunar objects targeted for surveillance.8 Utilizing formations of smaller satellites or distributed networks rather than single large platforms may offer benefits in coverage, cost, and resilience.9
Heterogeneous Sensor Integration: The architecture should be designed to integrate data from diverse sensor phenomenologies – optical (various wavelengths), radar (different frequencies/modes), passive RF, infrared, laser ranging – to provide a more complete characterization of objects and the environment, leveraging the strengths of each type.61
Data Infrastructure: A robust, scalable, and accessible data infrastructure is the backbone of the SSA system. This includes capabilities for efficient data transport, storage, processing, fusion, and dissemination. Architectures like the USSF's UDL aim to provide this capability, but effective implementation, integration with operational tools, and adherence to common standards are crucial for success.28 Standardized data formats (e.g., for observations, ephemeris, covariance, conjunction data messages) and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are essential for interoperability between sensors, processing centers, and users.28
6.3 Critical Technology Development Priorities
Achieving the required performance necessitates focused investment in key enabling technologies.

Advanced Sensors: Development should prioritize sensors with enhanced sensitivity capable of detecting faint objects at cislunar distances.12 This includes advanced optical detectors (e.g., low-noise, large-format, photon-counting), potentially compact and efficient radar technologies suitable for space deployment, and maturation of novel concepts like event-based sensors, passive RF systems, and space-based interferometers.31 Sensors must also be hardened for the cislunar radiation environment.56
Algorithms: Continued, intensive research and development are needed for algorithms specifically designed for cislunar SSA challenges.12 This includes robust IOD methods for sparse, angles-only data (e.g., advanced filters, collocation, ML-based approaches); accurate and efficient uncertainty propagation techniques for chaotic dynamics (e.g., STTs, multi-fidelity methods, GMMs); reliable CA algorithms accounting for non-Gaussian uncertainty; and sensitive maneuver detection algorithms (e.g., OCBE, Bayesian methods).
Data Fusion & AI: Further development of multi-sensor, multi-source data fusion techniques is crucial.81 Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) should be leveraged across the SSA chain – from automated detection in noisy sensor data, to orbit determination, prediction, data association (correlation), maneuver detection, object characterization, and intelligent sensor tasking.72
Autonomy: Developing capabilities for onboard processing, decision-making, and autonomous operations for space-based sensors is important.9 This can reduce reliance on continuous ground communication, decrease data downlink requirements (e.g., by processing images onboard and downlinking only detections or tracks), enable faster reaction times for sensor tasking or event detection, and improve overall system efficiency.23
Modeling & Simulation (M&S): High-fidelity M&S environments are essential for designing and evaluating candidate SSA architectures, testing and validating new algorithms, simulating sensor performance under realistic cislunar conditions, and generating synthetic data for training AI/ML models.14 These tools need to accurately capture multi-body dynamics, sensor physics, and environmental effects.
6.4 The Role of Policy, Standards, and Collaboration
Technical solutions alone are insufficient; a supportive framework of policy, standards, and collaboration is required.

National Strategy Alignment: Cislunar SSA efforts should be clearly aligned with overarching national goals and strategies, such as the US National Cislunar Science & Technology Strategy and the United States Space Priorities Framework, ensuring policy coherence and sustained support.1
Interagency Coordination: Effective coordination and collaboration between key government agencies – including USSF (operational SDA), NASA (exploration, science, deep space expertise), NOAA (space weather), and the Department of Commerce (civil/commercial SSA) – are vital.1 Leveraging existing MOUs and establishing clear roles and responsibilities will maximize efficiency and avoid duplication of effort.6
Commercial Engagement: The growing commercial space sector represents both a source of cislunar traffic and a potential provider of SSA data and services. Clear policies and processes are needed to effectively identify, evaluate, procure, and integrate commercial SSA capabilities into the national architecture.40 Defining the roles and responsibilities of commercial providers versus government functions is essential.
International Partnerships: Given the global interest in cislunar space and the cost of deploying comprehensive SSA systems, international collaboration is crucial.1 Establishing data sharing agreements, collaborating on sensor deployments (potentially leveraging partnerships like the Gateway program), and coordinating operations with allies and partners will enhance collective SSA capabilities.38
Standards Development: The development and adoption of internationally recognized standards are fundamental enablers for interoperability and data fusion.6 This includes standards for data formats (observations, orbits, covariance, CA messages), data quality metrics, communication protocols, and operational best practices (e.g., for conjunction assessment procedures).6 Active participation in international standards bodies is necessary.
Ultimately, establishing a robust, accurate, and timely cislunar SSA capability requires more than just technological advancements. It demands a holistic and integrated strategy that weaves together cutting-edge technology development (in sensors and algorithms) 12, optimized system architectures (balancing ground, space, and potentially lunar assets) 58, efficient and accessible data management infrastructure 66, supportive national policies aligned with strategic goals 6, internationally accepted standards enabling interoperability 6, and strong collaborative partnerships across government agencies, commercial industry, and international allies.1 Neglecting any one of these interconnected elements – whether it be inadequate sensor sensitivity, algorithms unable to cope with sparse data, data trapped in inaccessible silos, lack of common standards, or failure to collaborate – will significantly impede the overall effectiveness and sustainability of the cislunar SSA enterprise. Success hinges on addressing all these facets concurrently and cohesively.28

Conclusion
The burgeoning era of cislunar exploration, utilization, and strategic presence presents both immense opportunities and significant challenges. Central to navigating this new frontier safely and effectively is the establishment of a comprehensive, accurate, and timely Space Situational Awareness capability specifically tailored for the unique complexities of the Earth-Moon system. This report has detailed the distinct characteristics of the cislunar domain – its vast scale, complex multi-body dynamics, and harsh radiation environment – which fundamentally differentiate it from near-Earth space and render traditional SSA approaches insufficient.

The primary challenges identified – detecting faint objects across immense distances, predicting inherently chaotic trajectories from sparse data, and achieving adequate sensor coverage amidst numerous constraints – are deeply intertwined and demand innovative solutions. While current ground-based optical and radar systems offer some capabilities, they face significant limitations in sensitivity and coverage when applied to the cislunar regime. Existing space-based assets are largely focused elsewhere, highlighting a critical gap in dedicated cislunar monitoring infrastructure.

Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted strategy encompassing advancements across sensors, algorithms, architectures, and policy. Emerging technologies, including highly sensitive space-based sensors deployed in strategic cislunar orbits (potentially in distributed networks or formations), novel observation techniques like passive RF sensing and interferometry, and AI-enhanced processing, offer promising pathways to overcome current limitations. Concurrently, intensive development of advanced algorithms is paramount. This includes robust IOD techniques capable of handling sparse, angles-only data in non-Keplerian regimes (such as collocation and ML-based methods), accurate and efficient uncertainty propagation methods (like multi-fidelity approaches and STT-GMM combinations), and reliable algorithms for conjunction assessment and maneuver detection specifically designed for cislunar dynamics.

However, technological prowess alone is inadequate. A robust, hybrid sensor architecture optimizing the mix of ground, space, and potentially lunar assets is needed. Critically, this architecture must be supported by an effective data infrastructure, exemplified by the goals of the Unified Data Library, enabling seamless ingestion, fusion, and dissemination of data from diverse sources. This requires overcoming current integration challenges and establishing common data standards.

The path forward necessitates a holistic approach, integrating sustained investment in prioritized technology development with thoughtful architectural design, robust data management practices, and a supportive policy environment. Aligning efforts with national strategies, fostering strong interagency coordination, strategically engaging with the burgeoning commercial SSA sector, promoting international collaboration and data sharing, and actively participating in the development of operational standards are all essential components of this strategy. Achieving comprehensive cislunar SSA represents a paradigm shift from near-Earth practices, demanding a concerted, collaborative, and forward-looking effort. The success of future scientific discovery, commercial enterprise, exploration endeavors, and national security interests in the cislunar domain hinges on our ability to build and maintain this critical awareness capability.
