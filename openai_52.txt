Comparing the Investment Philosophies of Duan Yongping, Warren Buffett, and Charlie Munger
Introduction
Duan Yongping, Warren Buffett, and Charlie Munger are renowned value investors, each with a distinct approach rooted in fundamental analysis and long-term thinking. Duan Yongping – often dubbed “China’s Warren Buffett” ([Investment Insights: Duan Yongping's Portfolio Reveals Strategic](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2605466/investment-insights-duan-yongpings-portfolio-reveals-strategic-moves-with-key-stocks#:~:text=Duan Yongping%2C often dubbed as,off in the third quarter)) – is a successful entrepreneur-turned-investor who openly emulates Buffett and Munger’s principles. Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is famous for popularizing value investing and for his disciplined, long-term portfolio strategy. Charlie Munger, Buffett’s long-time partner and Berkshire’s vice chairman, complements Buffett’s style with a focus on mental models and rigorous multidisciplinary thinking. Below is a side-by-side comparison of their core investment principles, representative quotes, historical investing examples, and how their portfolios reflect their philosophies.

Core Investment Principles and Mental Models
Duan Yongping: Duan’s philosophy is firmly grounded in classic value investing tenets as defined by Buffett, emphasizing that buying a stock means buying part of a business ([Duan Yongping: There are three types of investment: no shorting, no borrowing, and no doing things you don't understand](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/6831906/duan-yongping-there-are-three-types-of-investment-no-shorting#:~:text=I would like to briefly,current basic understanding of investment)). He focuses on a company’s intrinsic value – the present value of its future cash flows – and insists on a margin of safety by only buying when the market price is well below that intrinsic value ([Duan Yongping: There are three types of investment: no shorting, no borrowing, and no doing things you don't understand](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/6831906/duan-yongping-there-are-three-types-of-investment-no-shorting#:~:text=2,the investor's own opportunity cost)). Duan is adamant about staying within his circle of competence. He cites Buffett’s advice to “don’t short, don’t borrow money, and… not to do what you don’t understand” as a bedrock principle ([Duan Yongping: my greatest wealth is the mistakes I have made](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/8465882/duan-yongping-my-greatest-wealth-is-the-mistakes-i-have#:~:text=I asked Buffett what he,do what you don't understand)). In practice, this means he avoids speculative bets and only invests in businesses he can thoroughly grasp. Duan looks for the “right business, the right person, the right price,” underscoring the importance of strong business models and ethical, capable management ([50 thoughts of Duan Yongping in the past 10 years: the difference between experts and ordinary people](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/5154933/50-thoughts-of-duan-yongping-in-the-past-10-years#:~:text=he believes in ,a profound impact on him)). In fact, he says the hallmark of his strategy is not trying to time the market, but instead focusing on business model and corporate culture quality ([100 Q&A with Duan Yongping last year: Involving Tencent, Apple, Moutai, life...](https://longportapp.com/en/news/106330133#:~:text=,business models %2B corporate culture)). This patient, business-centric approach reflects Buffett’s profound influence on him ([50 thoughts of Duan Yongping in the past 10 years: the difference between experts and ordinary people](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/5154933/50-thoughts-of-duan-yongping-in-the-past-10-years#:~:text=value investment,a profound impact on him)). It often takes Duan years of study to truly understand a company’s business; he notes that over a decade he “truly understood” only two companies (Apple and Moutai), averaging six years of study per company ([100 Q&A with Duan Yongping last year: Involving Tencent, Apple, Moutai, life...](https://longportapp.com/en/news/106330133#:~:text=

Warren Buffett: Buffett’s core principles have defined modern value investing. At the heart of his philosophy is the idea that price is what you pay, but value is what you get ([Warren Buffett: 14 Simplest Pieces of Money Advice That Can Work for Anyone | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffett-14-simplest-pieces-money-advice-can-work-anyone#:~:text=“Price is what you pay%3B,”)). He looks for businesses trading below their intrinsic value and relies on fundamentals rather than market sentiment. Buffett insists on investing within one’s circle of competence – you “don’t have to be an expert on every company… only evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries… is vital” ([Chairman's Letter - 1996](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1996.html#:~:text=investor needs is the ability,its boundaries%2C however%2C is vital)). This means Buffett will pass on “hot” industries if he doesn’t fully understand their economics; for decades he avoided tech stocks on that principle. Instead, he targets businesses with durable competitive advantages (“moats”), strong earnings power, and shareholder-friendly management. As he famously wrote, “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.” ([Chairman's Letter - 1989](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1989.html#:~:text=I could give you other,class managements)) In practice, Buffett and Munger set four filters for any investment: (1) an understandable business, (2) favorable long-term economics (a moat), (3) able and trustworthy management, and (4) a sensible price ([Chairman's Letter - 1989](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1989.html#:~:text=I

Charlie Munger: Munger’s investment philosophy overlaps heavily with Buffett’s – indeed, he helped shape Buffett’s evolution from cigar-butt investing to buying quality businesses. Munger is a value investor at core, but his mental models approach sets him apart. He advocates a “latticework of mental models” – drawing on knowledge from economics, psychology, mathematics, engineering, biology, etc. – to make better decisions. For example, Munger famously catalogued 25 cognitive biases that often lead investors astray ([The 60 Best Charlie Munger Quotes](https://www.suredividend.com/charlie-munger-quotes/#:~:text=On Psychology)), emphasizing the need to understand human psychology in investing. He agrees with Buffett on focusing only on what you can understand (“three baskets: yes, no, and too tough to understand” ([17 Charlie Munger quotes that teach us invaluable lessons about investing and life](https://www.justetf.com/en/academy/17-charlie-munger-quotes.html#:~:text=3%3A “We have three baskets for,”))), and on demanding a margin of safety, but he especially stresses quality. Munger is willing to pay up for an outstanding business. He summarizes his stance as: “Beta and modern portfolio theory and the like – none of it makes any sense to me. We’re trying to buy businesses with sustainable competitive advantages at a low, or even a fair, price.” (The 60 Best Charlie Munger Quotes). In other words, volatility is not risk to Munger; risk comes from not understanding what you’re doing. He prefers a lollapalooza outcome (great business + good price) over statistical comfort. A key Munger principle is patience and inactivity. “The big money is not in the buying or the selling, but in the waiting.” ([The 60 Best Charlie Munger Quotes](https://www.suredividend.com/charlie-munger-quotes/#:~:text=time

Famous Quotes Reflecting Their Philosophy
Duan Yongping: “A bet with a winning chance of over 90% is what I usually call an investment.” ([100 Q&A with Duan Yongping last year: Involving Tencent, Apple, Moutai, life...](https://longportapp.com/en/news/106330133#:~:text=,I usually call an investment)) – emphasizing that he only invests when he is highly confident in the outcome (in contrast to gambling on uncertain bets). He also highlights the importance of deep understanding: “In the past decade, I have truly understood two companies… On average, it takes me six years to understand one company.” ([100 Q&A with Duan Yongping last year: Involving Tencent, Apple, Moutai, life...](https://longportapp.com/en/news/106330133#:~:text=
Warren Buffett: “Price is what you pay; value is what you get.” ([Warren Buffett: 14 Simplest Pieces of Money Advice That Can Work for Anyone | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffett-14-simplest-pieces-money-advice-can-work-anyone#:~:text=“Price is what you pay%3B,”)) – encapsulating the essence of value investing (focus on the underlying value, not the price tag). Another of Buffett’s famous maxims is “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for ten years, don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes.” ([Chairman's Letter - 1996](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1996.html#:~:text=Your goal as an investor,companies whose aggregate earnings march)), a reminder of his long-term horizon and disdain for short-term trading. He often stresses temperament with quotes like “We don’t have to be smarter than the rest; we have to be more disciplined than the rest” (emphasizing emotional discipline) and his Rule No.1/Rule No.2: “Never lose money. Never forget Rule No.1.” ([Warren Buffett: 14 Simplest Pieces of Money Advice That Can Work for Anyone | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffett-14-simplest-pieces-money-advice-can-work-anyone#:~:text=Never
Charlie Munger: “The big money is not in the buying or the selling, but in the waiting.” ([The 60 Best Charlie Munger Quotes](https://www.suredividend.com/charlie-munger-quotes/#:~:text=time,was a virtue)) – a concise expression of Munger’s belief in patience and long-term focus. He also famously said, “We have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and too tough to understand.” ([17 Charlie Munger quotes that teach us invaluable lessons about investing and life](https://www.justetf.com/en/academy/17-charlie-munger-quotes.html#:~:text=3%3A “We have three baskets for,”)), reflecting his insistence on staying within one’s circle of competence and avoiding complexity for its own sake. Another notable Munger quote: “A lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they’ve got terrible temperaments.” ([17 Charlie Munger quotes that teach us invaluable lessons about investing and life](https://www.justetf.com/en/academy/17-charlie-munger-quotes.html#:~:text=1%3A ,driven crazy by extreme success)) – again highlighting the supremacy of psychology and self-control in investing success.
Historical Examples Illustrating Their Philosophy
Duan Yongping: One telling example is Duan’s massive investment in Apple Inc. After years of studying Apple, Duan gained conviction in its business model and product ecosystem. He started buying Apple stock in the 2010s and made it his single largest holding. By Q3 2024, Apple made up about 74% of his U.S. stock portfolio (managed via H&H Investment) ([Investment Insights: Duan Yongping's Portfolio Reveals Strategic](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2605466/investment-insights-duan-yongpings-portfolio-reveals-strategic-moves-with-key-stocks#:~:text=Apple ,of America was fully divested)) – an extraordinary concentration that reflects his confidence in Apple’s long-term value. This mirrors Buffett’s own affinity for Apple and indicates Duan’s “bet big when you’re sure” mentality. In China, Duan applied a similar approach with Kweichow Moutai (the dominant Chinese spirits company) and Tencent – he has stated that his main investments are “Apple for U.S. stocks, Moutai for A-shares, and Tencent for Hong Kong stocks” ([Investment Insights: Duan Yongping's Portfolio Reveals Strategic](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2605466/investment-insights-duan-yongpings-portfolio-reveals-strategic-moves-with-key-stocks#:~:text=Duan has shared on social,and strategically selling put options)), companies with wide moats in their domains. Duan’s contrarian streak showed during market panics: for instance, when Chinese e-commerce firm Pinduoduo saw its stock plunge 30% in a day, Duan disclosed that he began “bottom-fishing” it by selling put options, even though he admitted he did not yet fully understand Pinduoduo’s model ([Pinduoduo plunges, Duan Yongping bottom fishing in a smart way | RockFlow](https://help.rockflow.ai/blog/pinduoduo-plunges/#::text=Duan Yongping released a statement,starting to put selling points)) ([Pinduoduo plunges, Duan Yongping bottom fishing in a smart way | RockFlow](https://help.rockflow.ai/blog/pinduoduo-plunges/#:~:text=In fact%2C this is not,first time bottom fishing Pinduoduo)). This somewhat contravenes his usual rule (and he sized such trades modestly), but it illustrates his value-driven instinct to buy quality assets at distressed prices. Perhaps the clearest illustration of Duan sticking to Buffett/Munger principles is how he handled mistakes. In 2008, Duan paid $620,000 to have lunch with Warren Buffett, seeking wisdom. Buffett warned him never to short the market or invest with borrowed money ([Duan Yongping: my greatest wealth is the mistakes I have made](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/8465882/duan-yongping-my-greatest-wealth-is-the-mistakes-i-have#:~:text=I asked Buffett what he,do what you don't understand)). A few years later, Duan broke these rules by speculatively shorting Baidu (a company outside his circle of full understanding) – and lost on the order of $150–200 million ([Duan Yongping: my greatest wealth is the mistakes I have made](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/8465882/duan-yongping-my-greatest-wealth-is-the-mistakes-i-have#:~:text=Over the years%2C I have,where I really know it)) ([Duan Yongping: my greatest wealth is the mistakes I have made](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/8465882/duan-yongping-my-greatest-wealth-is-the-mistakes-i-have#:~:text=At first%2C I still wanted,couldn't turn over until now)). He has since called that his worst investment mistake, acknowledging it was “out-and-out speculation” and that he “ignored important conditions” he didn’t fully grasp ([Duan Yongping: my greatest wealth is the mistakes I have made](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/8465882/duan-yongping-my-greatest-wealth-is-the-mistakes-i-have#:~:text=What did you think to,should we learn from it)). Chastened, Duan now cites this episode as validation of Buffett’s rule “not to do what you don’t understand” ([Duan Yongping: my greatest wealth is the mistakes I have made](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/8465882/duan-yongping-my-greatest-wealth-is-the-mistakes-i-have#:~:text=I

Warren Buffett: Buffett’s investing history over seven decades provides rich examples of his philosophy at work. In the 1960s, one signature move was his contrarian investment in American Express. In 1964, Amex shares collapsed after the “salad oil scandal” (a major fraud incident). While others panicked, Buffett investigated the company’s core franchises (charge cards and travelers cheques) and concluded the business was sound and dominant. He famously poured roughly 40% of his partnership’s capital into Amex stock at the nadir – a bold demonstration of “being greedy when others are fearful.” Within a few years Amex recovered, rewarding Buffett’s nerve and analysis. Buffett later cited Amex as an example of a “great investment opportunity when a marvelous business encounters a one-time huge but solvable problem” ([Chairman's Letter - 1989](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1989.html#:~:text=occasion%2C tough problems must be,dragons than by slaying them)). In the 1970s, Buffett acquired See’s Candies for $25 million – a pivotal moment in his shift toward quality businesses. See’s was a simple chocolate company with an outstanding brand in the West Coast. Charlie Munger insisted they pay up for See’s well above book value, which Buffett initially hesitated on. The investment turned into a goldmine: See’s threw off tens of millions in cash annually with barely any need for new capital, thanks to its beloved brand and pricing power (they could raise prices 10% every year without losing customers) ([ This is What Munger Really Thinks About Buffett | Morningstar ](https://www.morningstar.hk/hk/news/243005/this-is-what-munger-really-thinks-about-buffett.aspx#::text=> ,rental stores when we bought)). See’s taught Buffett that a “wonderful business” could be worth far more than its tangible assets – reinforcing the idea of moats and pricing power as key to value. Buffett himself said buying See’s Candy “changed the way I look at businesses” and paved the way for later investments in high-quality companies. In the 1980s, Buffett made another iconic investment: The Coca-Cola Company. In 1988, not long after Coke had stumbled (from a failed product launch), Buffett started buying Coca-Cola aggressively. He ended up investing over $1 billion to acquire 7% of the company – a huge stake. Coke epitomized a Buffett stock: an “inevitable” product with a global brand moat, consistent demand, and the ability to raise prices with inflation. Sure enough, Buffett’s Coca-Cola stake has compounded for decades (it’s now worth around $25 billion+, and Berkshire still receives over $700 million in annual dividends from Coke). This holding, which Buffett has now kept for 35+ years, exemplifies “our favorite holding period is forever” and the power of letting a great business compound. In the 2010s, Buffett showed adaptability by investing in Apple Inc. – traditionally a tech company outside his circle, but he came to view Apple as more of a consumer products company with an ecosystem moat. Starting in 2016, Berkshire built a $35 billion position in Apple (around ~$125 per share cost basis). By 2022 that stake had ballooned to over $160 billion in value, making Apple Berkshire’s single largest holding ([ This is What Munger Really Thinks About Buffett | Morningstar ](https://www.morningstar.hk/hk/news/243005/this-is-what-munger-really-thinks-about-buffett.aspx#::text=Berkshire

Charlie Munger: Munger’s investing record, often intertwined with Buffett’s, also offers instructive examples. Perhaps the most famous is See’s Candies (mentioned above), which Munger pushed Berkshire to buy in 1972. Munger recognized See’s had an intangible asset – brand loyalty across generations of Californians – that gave it pricing power. He was willing to pay a then-high price (3× book value) for See’s, convinced it would produce great returns on capital. As noted, See’s validated this view by delivering enormous cash without needing new capital year after year, because of its moat ([ This is What Munger Really Thinks About Buffett | Morningstar ](https://www.morningstar.hk/hk/news/243005/this-is-what-munger-really-thinks-about-buffett.aspx#::text=> ,rental stores when we bought)). This single $25 million purchase has generated over $2 billion of cumulative pre-tax earnings for Berkshire – a testament to Munger’s “buy great businesses” credo. Another striking example is BYD, the Chinese electric vehicle and battery company. It was Munger who in 2008 learned about BYD’s founder and tech from his friend (investment manager Li Lu). Munger persuaded Buffett that BYD was an exceptional business with a visionary leader – effectively, an inevitable player in electric cars – and Berkshire invested about $232 million for a 10% stake ([Munger Says He Told Buffett of Stake in BYD, Recused Himself](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-04-05/munger-says-he-told-buffett-of-byd-stake-stayed-out-of-berkshire-s-talks#::text=Munger Says He Told Buffett,18)). BYD proved to be a spectacular investment: within a decade the stake was worth over $1½ billion, and by 2022 it was valued around $7–8 billion (Berkshire began trimming it after 14 years of holding) ([Munger Says He Told Buffett of Stake in BYD, Recused Himself](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-04-05/munger-says-he-told-buffett-of-byd-stake-stayed-out-of-berkshire-s-talks#:~:text=Himself www,18)) ([Charlie Munger says BYD was his best investment at Berkshire ...](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-munger-says-byd-best-094339069.html#:~:text=Charlie Munger says BYD was,in 2008 for %24230 million)). Munger called BYD one of Berkshire’s best investments and an example of a company with a huge long-term runway where patience paid off. This also highlighted Munger’s openness to investing in China and in tech-forward companies when he has high conviction (here, BYD’s battery technology and cost advantages). Closer to home, Munger ran a smaller portfolio through the Daily Journal Corporation (DJCO), where he is chairman. After 2009, Munger took DJCO’s surplus cash (originally stemming from legal settlement proceeds) and plowed it into just a few stocks: mainly Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and a handful of others – all during the depressed prices of the financial crisis. He effectively bet on a recovery of strong banks. He held those positions for many years; e.g. Daily Journal held large stakes in WFC and BAC for over a decade, only selling some recently. As of 2025, DJCO’s equity portfolio consists of only 4 stocks, with Wells Fargo ~47% and Bank of America ~39% (together 85% of the portfolio) ([Charlie Munger Portfolio (2025 Q1) - Daily Journal Corp Holdings 13F](https://valuesider.com/guru/charlie-munger-daily-journal-corp/portfolio#::text=In Daily Journal Corp's portfolio,34)). This extreme concentration shows Munger’s willingness to put most eggs in a few very sturdy baskets. It also reflects his long-term approach – he was willing to hold through years of volatility (including Wells Fargo’s scandals) because he believed in the banks’ core earnings power. Munger has also demonstrated the courage to change his mind: an example is his investment in Alibaba in 2021–2022 for DJCO. Initially, Munger bought a sizable stake in Alibaba (seeing it as a dominant franchise trading cheaply amid China’s tech crackdown), but as uncertainties grew, he admitted it was “one of the worst mistakes” he’d made recently and substantially cut the position in 2022 ([Charlie Munger Called Alibaba 'One of the Worst Mistakes I Ever ...](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-munger-called-alibaba-one-230116375.html#:~:text=Charlie Munger Called Alibaba 'One,5)). This willingness to rationally cut losses echoes his mantra “Correcting mistakes should be done as soon as possible, and the cost is always the smallest” ([100 Q&A with Duan Yongping last year: Involving Tencent, Apple, Moutai, life...](https://longportapp.com/en/news/106330133#:~:text=,cost is always the smallest)). Finally, Munger’s personal portfolio has long been essentially just Berkshire Hathaway stock and Costco stock – he held both for decades. He was on Costco’s board for 40 years and has praised Costco as a model of a great business (low costs, strong culture, customer loyalty). His reluctance to ever sell Costco (Buffett once joked that Munger would rather “die” than sell Costco) and Berkshire shares exemplifies the “buy well, never sell” mindset. In sum, Munger’s investment actions – from See’s to BYD to his focused DJCO bets – all illustrate his core beliefs: concentrate in the very best opportunities, think long term, and don’t hesitate to act (or cut bait) when rigorous thinking dictates so.

Portfolio Reflections of Their Principles
Duan Yongping’s Portfolio: Duan’s holdings are highly concentrated and aligned with his value convictions. His U.S. stock portfolio (H&H International) was worth about $16.5 billion in late 2024 and consisted of just 8 stocks. Apple alone accounted for roughly three-quarters of the portfolio – an enormous concentration in one company ([Investment Insights: Duan Yongping's Portfolio Reveals Strategic](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2605466/investment-insights-duan-yongpings-portfolio-reveals-strategic-moves-with-key-stocks#:~:text=Apple ,of America was fully divested)). This reflects Duan’s confidence in Apple’s business (and indeed parallels Buffett’s own Apple-heavy allocation). His second-largest position was Berkshire Hathaway itself (10% of the U.S. portfolio) ([Investment Insights: Duan Yongping's Portfolio Reveals Strategic](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2605466/investment-insights-duan-yongpings-portfolio-reveals-strategic-moves-with-key-stocks#::text=Apple

Warren Buffett’s/Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio: Berkshire Hathaway’s equity portfolio is the embodiment of Buffett’s philosophy: concentrated, low-turnover, and focused on quality. As of the end of 2024, Berkshire’s roughly $267 billion stock portfolio had an astonishing 90% of its value in just its top 10 holdings ([BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC Top 13F Holdings - WhaleWisdom.com](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc#:~:text=regarded as the ultimate value,with shares held of 300%2C000%2C000)). The largest position is Apple (approx. 300 million shares) ([BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC Top 13F Holdings - WhaleWisdom.com](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc#:~:text=copying,with shares held of 300%2C000%2C000)), which at times has been 40–50% of the entire portfolio by market value ([Warren Buffett’s 2025 Portfolio: What Stocks He’s Betting Big On Right Now](https://www.investopedia.com/warren-buffett-s-stock-portfolio-11719778#::text=1,February 2025 letter to shareholders)) ([ This is What Munger Really Thinks About Buffett | Morningstar ](https://www.morningstar.hk/hk/news/243005/this-is-what-munger-really-thinks-about-buffett.aspx#:~:text=Buffett's most high,of Berkshire's stock portfolio)). Other top holdings include longtime stalwarts like Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Chevron ([Warren Buffett’s 2025 Portfolio: What Stocks He’s Betting Big On Right Now](https://www.investopedia.com/warren-buffett-s-stock-portfolio-11719778#:~:text=,year include a stake in)). Many of these have been in the portfolio for decades: Coca-Cola since 1988, American Express and Moody’s since the 1990s, etc. This reflects Buffett’s buy-and-hold discipline – he very rarely sells a core holding. In fact, Berkshire’s portfolio turnover is famously low; Buffett quipped that his favorite holding period is “forever,” and indeed he held on through periods of underperformance as long as the thesis (and management integrity) stayed intact. The portfolio also skews heavily toward sectors Buffett understands well: consumer staples/brands, financial services, energy, and more recently high-quality tech (Apple). It avoids cutting-edge tech, biotech, or other areas outside Buffett’s circle. No short positions, no use of leverage, and a sizeable cash reserve are also characteristics of Berkshire’s holdings – reinforcing the capital preservation mindset. Another aspect is that Berkshire often owns entire companies in addition to the stock portfolio, but even those reflect the philosophy: Buffett owns outright companies like See’s Candies, GEICO, BNSF Railroad, Dairy Queen, etc., which were purchased because they have durable businesses and were bought at fair prices. Within the stock portfolio, position sizing speaks volumes: Buffett will make a giant bet when he has utmost conviction (Apple, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, etc.), and those positions dwarf any “experimental” smaller stakes. For example, the top 5 holdings (Apple, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, American Express, Chevron) comprised over 75% of the equity portfolio by early 2023 ([Berkshire Hathaway Holdings by Weight - Slickcharts](https://www.slickcharts.com/berkshire-hathaway#:~:text=Berkshire Hathaway Holdings by Weight,company%2C the trick is)). This high concentration is a direct manifestation of Buffett’s belief that “putting big money in your best ideas” beats diworsification. It’s also noteworthy that Berkshire’s portfolio can be very patient: Buffett held a mountain of cash through much of the 2010s, waiting for the right opportunities; then in 2022–2023, he deployed tens of billions into stocks like Chevron, Occidental Petroleum, Japanese trading companies, etc., when he saw value. This opportunistic allocation of capital – pouncing only when margin of safety is evident – is a hallmark of how the portfolio is managed. Finally, Berkshire’s habit of compounding positions (adding more on dips, as he did with Bank of America in 2020 ([Investment Insights: Duan Yongping's Portfolio Reveals Strategic](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2605466/investment-insights-duan-yongpings-portfolio-reveals-strategic-moves-with-key-stocks#:~:text=Duan Yongping%2C often dubbed as,off in the third quarter)), or trimming when valuations get rich) shows an active application of value judgments even within long-term holdings. In summary, the Buffett portfolio is concentrated in high-quality, cash-generative businesses, held for the very long run, with minimal churn – the concrete result of Buffett and Munger’s investment credo.

Charlie Munger’s Portfolio (Daily Journal and Personal Holdings): Munger’s approach to portfolio construction is even more concentrated than Buffett’s. As chairman of Daily Journal Corp (a small publishing and software company), he oversaw its investment of surplus capital into marketable securities. By Q1 2025, Daily Journal held only four stocks: Wells Fargo (47% of the portfolio value), Bank of America (39%), Alibaba (12%), and U.S. Bancorp (2%) ([Charlie Munger Portfolio (2025 Q1) - Daily Journal Corp Holdings 13F](https://valuesider.com/guru/charlie-munger-daily-journal-corp/portfolio#:~:text=In Daily Journal Corp's portfolio,34)). This concentrated bet on two financial giants (together 85% of assets) and one Chinese tech titan shows Munger’s practice of putting a few eggs in very strong baskets and watching them closely. He chose Wells Fargo and BofA in 2009 when bank stocks were extremely cheap and likely to recover – a classic Graham-and-Dodd style value play combined with his intimate knowledge of banking (Munger sat on Wells Fargo’s board for years). He held those positions for a long time, indicating conviction in their resilience and the patience to wait for the thesis to play out. The Alibaba stake (first bought in 2021) was a deviation into international tech, reflecting Munger’s willingness to venture outside the U.S. for value. However, after Alibaba’s price fell and China’s regulatory environment shifted, Daily Journal cut the Alibaba position in half by 2022 – showing that Munger will correct course when facts change (a nod to his principle of avoiding prolonged mistakes). Daily Journal’s lack of diversification and low turnover (aside from the Alibaba tweak, Munger hardly traded the portfolio over ten-plus years ([Charlie Munger Holdings (Stock Buys/Sells) - Daily Journal Corp ...](https://valuesider.com/guru/charlie-munger-daily-journal-corp/portfolio-activity#::text=Charlie Munger Holdings ,Corp buying now%3F In))) underscores his belief that you only need to own a few great things. Munger’s personal holdings further demonstrate this: the bulk of his net worth has long been in Berkshire Hathaway stock, alongside a significant holding in Costco (a company he admires deeply). He famously never sold a share of Berkshire or Costco for decades, reflecting not only loyalty but a view that those businesses continuously created value – so why trade them? Indeed, Munger often said the tax efficiency of long-term holding is an underrated advantage. Another facet of Munger’s portfolio philosophy is quality bias – he would rather own a great business at a fair price than a mediocre one at bargain price (mirroring Buffett’s shift). For example, he influenced Berkshire to invest in Costco in the 1990s and early 2000s (Berkshire did buy Costco stock and held it until around 2020). Even though retail was not Buffett’s favorite sector, Munger saw Costco’s strong culture and customer loyalty as a winning formula. His family investment in Costco (and his public praise of the company) show that he puts his money where his mouth is regarding exceptional businesses. Finally, Munger’s portfolios hold virtually no cash – he prefers to be fully invested in his best ideas (Daily Journal actually borrowed modestly at one point to buy more stocks during the 2009 lows, a move Munger joked was him imitating Buffett’s use of float). This indicates Munger’s opportunistic aggressiveness when he deems the odds heavily in his favor, consistent with the man who said he’s “eager for a few great opportunities” and otherwise happy to sit on his hands. In essence, Munger’s portfolios (both DJCO and personal) epitomize focus, conviction, and long-term horizon, with a clear skew toward businesses he considers fundamentally superior – exactly aligning with the mental models and principles he advocates.

Conclusion
All three investors share a common foundation in value investing – seeking mispriced securities based on business fundamentals – but they apply it in slightly different flavors. Buffett can be seen as the archetype: favoring businesses with durable moats, bought with a margin of safety, and held indefinitely. Munger amplifies the focus on quality and multidisciplinary thinking, pushing Buffett (and others) to widen the lens to include qualitative factors like corporate culture and psychological biases. Duan Yongping, as a disciple of Buffett and Munger, demonstrates how these principles can be applied in different markets (U.S. and China) – he combines Buffett’s value discipline with an entrepreneur’s insight into business models, and he isn’t afraid to concentrate his bets similarly. Their mental models and tenets overlap considerably: all three stress knowing your circle of competence, valuing businesses (not speculating on stocks), and exercising emotional control and patience. Where they differ tends to be in emphasis: Munger evangelizes learning across disciplines and avoiding folly, Buffett communicates ideas with memorable aphorisms and sticks to what has worked for 60+ years, and Duan blends these learned principles with his own experience in tech and Chinese markets. Ultimately, the results of their philosophies are visible in their portfolios and track records. Each has achieved superior long-term returns by being conservative yet bold – conservative in requiring a high margin of safety and solid economics, yet bold in committing large capital to their highest-confidence ideas and holding through volatility. For an investor with a quantitative finance background, the takeaway is that while these legends may not run quant models, they each operate with a profound understanding of risk vs. reward (in Duan’s terms, only making 90%-probability bets ([100 Q&A with Duan Yongping last year: Involving Tencent, Apple, Moutai, life...](https://longportapp.com/en/news/106330133#:~:text=,I usually call an investment))) and a keen eye on expected value. Their success underscores that sound investment principles, disciplined execution, and the right temperament can consistently beat the market – whether in an Omaha boardroom or a Shenzhen office. Each of these investors, in his own way, exemplifies how sticking to well-founded mental models and core principles can yield extraordinary investment outcomes over the long run ([BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC Top 13F Holdings - WhaleWisdom.com](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc#:~:text=regarded as the ultimate value,with shares held of 300%2C000%2C000)) ([The 60 Best Charlie Munger Quotes](https://www.suredividend.com/charlie-munger-quotes/#:~:text=time,was a virtue)).
