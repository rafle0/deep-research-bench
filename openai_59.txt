Bird Migration and Navigation: Mechanisms, Cues, and Disruptions
Birds undertaking seasonal migrations use an impressive suite of sensory and neural mechanisms to determine their position and heading. Migratory species integrate multiple cues – including geomagnetic, celestial, olfactory, and visual information – through specialized receptors and brain circuits to maintain remarkably accurate navigation over thousands of kilometers. At the physiological level, birds possess magnetoreceptors (both light-driven and magnetite-based), dedicated brain regions, and an integrated sensory network that together compute “compass” and “map” information. These biological systems allow birds to calibrate their internal compasses (sun, star, polarized light, magnetic) and maps (magnetic intensity, olfactory gradients, landmarks) to navigate toward distant breeding or wintering grounds. Migrants also adjust their routes in response to winds and weather, and have evolved resilience (and sometimes vulnerability) to natural perturbations. However, modern anthropogenic factors – artificial light, noise, and electromagnetic “smog” – can disrupt one or more navigational cues, with consequences for migration success.

This report reviews the latest scientific findings on avian navigation during migration. We first survey physiological mechanisms (magnetoreceptors, brain structures, sensory integration) that underlie navigation. Next, we detail the environmental cues birds use (celestial cues, geomagnetic field, odor and infrasound maps, visual landmarks, polarized light). We then discuss differences in navigation strategies among major bird groups (night-migratory songbirds, ocean-going seabirds, and diurnal raptors). Finally, we examine how natural disturbances (winds, storms, solar events, climate anomalies) and anthropogenic factors (light and noise pollution, electromagnetic interference) influence migratory orientation. Throughout, we cite recent peer-reviewed research to provide an up-to-date, comprehensive picture.

Physiological Mechanisms of Navigation
Birds sense directional and positional cues using multiple magnetoreception mechanisms and dedicated neural circuits that integrate sensory information into a navigational “GPS” and compass. Two main magnetoreceptor hypotheses have experimental support: radical-pair photoreceptors in the eyes (light-dependent compass) and magnetite-based receptors in the head (beak/vestibular). The radical-pair system uses photopigments (cryptochromes) in retinal cells that form magnetically-sensitive electron pairs under certain wavelengths of light. These retinal receptors allow birds to “see” the geomagnetic field as a visual pattern overlaid on their surroundings ([Protein-protein interaction of the putative magnetoreceptor cryptochrome 4 expressed in the avian retina | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64429-y#:~:text=Night,birds´ visual system11 %2C 35%2C13)) ([Visual but not trigeminal mediation of magnetic compass information in a migratory bird - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19865170/#:~:text=the eyes and that this,mediated)). Behavioral studies show that many night-migratory songbirds use a light-dependent magnetic compass: they sense the inclination of field lines (angle relative to Earth’s surface) rather than polarity, and this sense operates only under blue-green light ([Protein-protein interaction of the putative magnetoreceptor cryptochrome 4 expressed in the avian retina | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64429-y#:~:text=Night

Multiple sensors in the head appear to feed magnetic information to the brain. For example, magnetically-induced neuronal activation has been observed in discrete brain areas involved in spatial orientation and memory ([Magnetoreception in an avian brain in part mediated by inner ear lagena - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21353559/#:~:text=Many animals use the Earth's,specific set of magnetic field)). Le-Qing Wu et al. used c-Fos labeling in pigeons and found magnetic stimulation activated neurons in vestibular nuclei (inner ear), thalamus, hippocampus, and other orientation-related regions ([Magnetoreception in an avian brain in part mediated by inner ear lagena - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21353559/#:~:text=Many

Other brain regions also contribute. The hippocampus (medial pallium) – crucial for spatial memory – is involved in map-like navigation and landmark memory ([Magnetoreception in an avian brain in part mediated by inner ear lagena - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21353559/#:~:text=Many animals use the Earth's,specific set of magnetic field)) ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=With the exception of birds,revealed that memory of the)). Head-direction (HD) cells, analogous to those in mammals, have been identified in migratory birds. Recent neural recording in juvenile streaked shearwaters found HD cells in the medial pallium that consistently signaled “northward” regardless of visual cues, suggesting an internal compass reference aligned with geomagnetic north ([Head direction cells in a migratory bird prefer north - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35119935/#:~:text=migration%2C during which they strongly,the direction and magnetoreception senses)). These HD cells imply an integration of magnetoreceptive input with directional heading signals in the brain. Thus birds can form a stable internal directional framework even without external cues. The brain likely integrates multiple sensory inputs: vision (sun, stars, landmarks), olfaction, hearing (infrasound/aural cues), and magnetism, combining them into a coherent navigational estimate.

In summary, migratory birds have (at least) two magnetoreceptors – a light-dependent retinal compass and an iron-based magnetite sensor – whose signals are processed in the brain. The retina/cluster N pathway provides a light-dependent compass (inclination-based), whereas the beak/lagena system may provide additional intensity-based or map cues ([Magnetoreception in an avian brain in part mediated by inner ear lagena - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21353559/#:~:text=Many animals use the Earth's,specific set of magnetic field)) ([Visual but not trigeminal mediation of magnetic compass information in a migratory bird - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19865170/#:~:text=the eyes and that this,mediated)). The neural machinery includes Cluster N, the visual system, hippocampus, vestibular nuclei, and HD-cell networks that together compute both compass directions and spatial location. Birds thus achieve robust navigation by pooling these multiple streams – a sensory fusion of magnetism, celestial cues, odors, and familiar landmarks – in their brain.

Environmental Navigation Cues
Migrating birds exploit a suite of external cues as references for direction and position. These cues fall broadly into celestial, geomagnetic, olfactory/chemical, and visual categories. Birds typically use whichever cues are available to them at a given time of day, season, or weather condition, often cross-calibrating one compass against another.

Celestial cues (sun, stars, polarized light): Many migrants use the sun and stars as compasses. Diurnal migrants can use a time-compensated sun compass: by knowing the local time (via an internal clock) and the sun’s azimuth, they infer direction ([The Basics: How Birds Navigate When They Migrate](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/the-basics-migration-navigation/#:~:text=The Basics%3A How Birds Navigate,time compensation ability to)). Migratory songbirds, especially nocturnal migrants, famously use the star patterns at night. Classic Emlen funnel experiments showed that indigo buntings and other night-migrants learn the rotation of constellations around the celestial pole to find “north” ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=Star,means that songbirds in the)). These birds do not latch onto a single star (e.g. Polaris) but derive orientation from the overall pattern rotation ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=Star
Geomagnetic field: The Earth’s magnetic field is a critical compass cue for virtually all migratory birds. Birds measure the field’s inclination angle (steepness) and possibly its intensity/declination to get both compass and map information. As noted above, many species detect inclination (making their compass an inclination compass, insensitive to north vs. south polarity ([Protein-protein interaction of the putative magnetoreceptor cryptochrome 4 expressed in the avian retina | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64429-y#:~:text=These behavioural studies further showed,visual system 34%2C12 %2C 36))). They may also sense magnetic intensity or declination variations as part of a “magnetic map” for position-fixing. For example, one recent long-distance displacement study showed that birds use a combination of inclination and magnetic declination to calculate their geographic location ([ Space weather disrupts nocturnal bird migration - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10589677/#:~:text=associated with each radar station,overcast conditions and high geomagnetic)). Typically, birds calibrate their magnetic compass against celestial cues – for instance, they may orient by the setting sun and then align that to magnetic north at twilight ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=match at L964 calibrate their,as)).
Olfactory cues: Many bird species have a surprisingly well-developed sense of smell and use olfactory gradients or odor “maps”. Homing pigeons rely on a learned “olfactory map” of wind-borne odors around their home loft, and having their nostrils plugged severely disrupts their homing ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=coastlines%2C mountain ridges%2C or rivers,parallel to the mountains%2C with)). Seabirds (petrels, shearwaters) over featureless oceans use odors (e.g. dimethyl sulfide from plankton blooms) to locate productive feeding areas and possibly to find islands or colonies ([Seabirds Use Their Sense of Smell to Navigate Open Water](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/seabirds-use-their-sense-smell-navigate-open-water-180964674/#:~:text=Past researchers have tackled the,return to their home territory)). In one experiment, Scopoli’s shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) fitted with magnets still navigated normally, but shearwaters made temporarily anosmic (zinc sulfate nasal irrigation) took highly erratic, non-directed routes across the sea ([Seabirds Use Their Sense of Smell to Navigate Open Water](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/seabirds-use-their-sense-smell-navigate-open-water-180964674/#:~:text=Past
Landmarks and topography: Visual landmarks guide many migrants, especially during the end stages of a journey. Coastal lines, mountain ridges, and rivers often channel migration corridors. For instance, many raptors and waterbirds migrating south along Europe turn to follow the Alps or Mediterranean coast rather than cross high mountains ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=In some cases%2C birds orient,features such as coastlines and)). Raptors in particular use thermal updrafts along ridges and valleys; they often “ridgeline-follow” on migration to conserve energy (see figure below) ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=Hudson River (Bingman et al,Figure 5%3B Bildstein 2006)). Even songbirds and pigeons use landmarks when within familiar territory or in the final homing phase: homing pigeons, after narrowing in on the general area, use visual cues (buildings, features) to pinpoint their loft ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=With the exception of birds,revealed that memory of the)).
Polarized light: In addition to aiding calibration, the pattern of polarized sky light can itself serve as a directional cue. During the day, the sky’s polarization axis is perpendicular to the sun’s azimuth; experiments show that altering polarized light can mislead a bird’s magnetic compass reading, indicating that birds register polarization patterns ([Polarized light modulates light-dependent magnetic compass ...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26811473/#:~:text=,findings are the first)). At dawn and dusk, the band of maximal polarization sweeps across the sky; birds can use this twilight polarization band to set and calibrate their compasses at sunrise/sunset ([Feasibility of sun and magnetic compass mechanisms in avian long-distance migration | Movement Ecology | Full Text](https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40462-018-0126-4#:~:text=Birds use different compass mechanisms,the adaptive values of the)) ([Polarized light modulates light-dependent magnetic compass ...](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1513391113#:~:text=skylight polarization pattern for orientation,reviewed by)).
In practice, migratory birds use all available cues in concert. Birds often show multi-modal integration: for example, many night migrants calibrate their magnetic compass against the setting sun or twilight polarization before continuing on a magnetic heading ([Feasibility of sun and magnetic compass mechanisms in avian long-distance migration | Movement Ecology | Full Text](https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40462-018-0126-4#:~:text=Birds use different compass mechanisms,the adaptive values of the)). If one cue is unavailable (e.g. overcast sky or heavy geomagnetic disturbance), they may rely more on another.

Navigation Strategies in Different Bird Groups
Different groups of birds emphasize different cues and strategies depending on their ecology and sensory specializations. Below we compare songbirds (passerines), seabirds, and raptors:

Songbirds (Nocturnal Migrants).
Many small migratory songbirds (warblers, sparrows, thrushes, etc.) migrate at night. These nocturnal migrants typically rely heavily on celestial and magnetic compasses. They learn star patterns in spring and fall, using planetarium experiments show that young birds imprint the rotation of constellations to identify north ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=Star,means that songbirds in the)). Their sun compass (used at dusk/dawn) is time-compensated – experiments shifting a bird’s clock cause predictable deflections of its apparent “north” relative to the sun. Songbirds also possess the radical-pair magnetoreceptor (cryptochrome in the retina) and use the Earth’s magnetic field for direction and possibly map cues ([Protein-protein interaction of the putative magnetoreceptor cryptochrome 4 expressed in the avian retina | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64429-y#:~:text=These behavioural studies further showed,visual system 34%2C12 %2C 36)) ([Visual but not trigeminal mediation of magnetic compass information in a migratory bird - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19865170/#:~:text=the eyes and that this,mediated)). The forebrain Cluster N is particularly active in night-migrating songbirds when the magnetic compass is engaged ([Night-time neuronal activation of Cluster N in a North American songbird | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300479#:~:text=Night,is lateralized and the full)). Recent work on a North American thrush (Swainson’s thrush) shows a large bilateral Cluster N region activated at night ([Night-time neuronal activation of Cluster N in a North American songbird | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0300479#:~:text=migratory North American songbird%2C to,highly conserved in nocturnal migrants)), indicating this mechanism is widespread. When migrating, songbirds may also use familiar landmarks (rivers, coasts), but as nocturnal migrants they cannot rely on vision in flight; instead they extract orientation information from stars, sun polarization, magnetism and occasionally infrasound (ocean wave sounds) for a coarse map ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=,objects in the environment by)) ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=match

Seabirds (Ocean Migrants).
Seabirds such as albatrosses, shearwaters, petrels, and boobies migrate over vast oceanic distances. Over featureless water, olfaction plays a major role. Many procellariiform seabirds have enormous olfactory bulbs: they can detect wind-borne odors from hundreds of kilometers away. For example, Cory’s shearwaters learn the odors of their colony and coastal landmarks; anosmic shearwaters lose their homing ability over open water ([Seabirds Use Their Sense of Smell to Navigate Open Water](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/seabirds-use-their-sense-smell-navigate-open-water-180964674/#:~:text=Past researchers have tackled the,return to their home territory)). Seabirds may navigate by following olfactory “traffic lanes” – prevailing odors carried by winds – effectively using an odor map. They also use the sun compass and magnetic cues: young albatrosses imprint on the sun’s position at fledging, and displaced shearwaters can still head in the correct direction, suggesting a geomagnetic map contribution. Many seabirds (especially tubenoses) also orient by the low-frequency sounds of waves on distant shorelines (infrasound) ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=Landmarks may be useful for,seems most likely because ‘map)). Wind and weather strongly influence their flight paths: gliding seabirds use dynamic soaring and tailwinds and will time departures with favorable winds. In some species, age and experience matter: juvenile albatrosses rely more on inherited directions, whereas adults use environmental cues and memory to fine-tune routes.

(Seabirds Use Their Sense of Smell to Navigate Open Water) Figure: A Scopoli’s shearwater (a seabird) in flight over the Mediterranean. Seabirds (Procellariiformes) use olfactory and wind-borne cues over open ocean to navigate to distant breeding colonies ([Seabirds Use Their Sense of Smell to Navigate Open Water](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/seabirds-use-their-sense-smell-navigate-open-water-180964674/#:~:text=Past researchers have tackled the,return to their home territory)).

Raptors (Diurnal Migrants).
Diurnal raptors (hawks, eagles, falcons) migrate by day using soaring flight. They typically rely on visual and topographic cues more than celestial ones. Thermal columns and updrafts are critical: raptors follow mountain ridges and coastlines that generate lift, enabling energy-efficient soaring ([Avian Navigation and Orientation](https://avesbiology.com/nav_orient.html#:~:text=Hudson River (Bingman et al,Figure 5%3B Bildstein 2006)). They use the sun compass when visible, but like other birds they can switch to magnetic orientation under overcast skies. Because raptors migrate by day in groups (kettles), social facilitation and route memory may also play roles. Visual landmarks (mountain gaps, rivers, coastlines) strongly shape their migration “flyways.” Raptors have not been shown to use olfactory cues appreciably. Their navigation seems more dependent on experience and learning of geographic routes. For example, adult broad-winged hawks migrating over the Appalachians tend to follow similar paths each year along topographic features. Unlike nocturnal songbirds, raptors must contend with thermal availability, so their migratory speed and path are sensitive to weather conditions.

In summary, nocturnal songbirds lean on magnetic and celestial compasses (with key brain structures like Cluster N), seabirds exploit smell and wind/oceanic cues along with magnetism, and raptors use sun compass, visual landmarks, and thermal soaring. All groups use a combination of strategies adapted to their lifestyle, and many can switch between cues when needed.

Influence of Natural Disturbances
Migration routes and timing are heavily influenced by natural environmental variability. Birds have evolved to respond flexibly to changing winds, weather, and geomagnetic conditions, but extreme events can pose challenges.

Winds and weather: Predominant wind patterns dictate many migration paths. Tailwinds enable fuel-efficient, high-speed flight, while headwinds can greatly slow progress or even ground migrants. Climate change is already shifting wind regimes: one study projects stronger southerly (tail-)winds in spring and stronger headwinds in fall for many North American migrants ([Research: How Will the Winds of Climate Change Affect Migratory Birds? - BirdCast](https://birdcast.info/news/research-how-will-the-winds-of-climate-change-affect-migratory-birds/#:~:text=La Sorte and co,eastern portions of the continent)). These changes (illustrated in the figure below) imply easier spring migrations but more difficult autumn flights in the future. Birds compensate by adjusting headings or flight altitudes; for example, many small migrants will wait for nights with favorable tailwinds or ascend to altitudes with weaker headwinds. Migratory timing may shift: if headwinds make flying too costly, birds may delay departure until conditions improve ([Research: How Will the Winds of Climate Change Affect Migratory Birds? - BirdCast](https://birdcast.info/news/research-how-will-the-winds-of-climate-change-affect-migratory-birds/#:~:text=La (Research: How Will the Winds of Climate Change Affect Migratory Birds? - BirdCast) Figure: Predicted wind assistance for migratory birds under climate change (La Sorte *et al.*, 2018). In this U.S. map, red/orange dots indicate stronger future tailwinds (spring); blue/green dots indicate stronger headwinds (autumn). Changes in wind patterns (tailwind vs. headwind) will affect energy costs and timing of migration ([Research: How Will the Winds of Climate Change Affect Migratory Birds? - BirdCast](https://birdcast.info/news/research-how-will-the-winds-of-climate-change-affect-migratory-birds/#:~:text=La Sorte and co,eastern portions of the continent)). Storms and extreme weather can detour or delay migrants. Strong cold fronts can create explosive, dense migration waves, while hurricanes and cyclones can scatter birds widely (often leading to mass casualties). Birds often exhibit “flight path adjustments” around storms: they may fly lower to avoid headwinds or land to wait out bad weather. Droughts or heat waves on the breeding or wintering grounds can also shift migration timing (e.g. birds leave later from northern breeding areas in warm springs).
Geomagnetic disturbances (“space weather”): Solar storms and magnetic substorms can temporarily disrupt the Earth’s magnetic field. A 2023 radar-tracking study found that intense geomagnetic disturbances (caused by solar coronal mass ejections) correlate with fewer nocturnally migrating birds being aloft ([ Space weather disrupts nocturnal bird migration - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10589677/#:~:text=associated with each radar station,overcast conditions and high geomagnetic)). Specifically, strong magnetic disturbances in fall reduced migration intensity by 9–17% and caused birds to drift more with the wind (less active orientation) ([ Space weather disrupts nocturnal bird migration - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10589677/#:~:text=associated
Climate anomalies: Phenomena like El Niño or long-term climate change can alter habitat quality and wind patterns, thus indirectly affecting navigation. For example, El Niño years shift storm tracks, which has been associated with drift and unusual influxes of migrants to unexpected regions. Over generations, birds may adjust migratory routes in response to shifting climate; indeed, recent studies suggest range shifts and route shifts (e.g. some European songbirds now winter farther north than historically). These changes imply birds are continually recalibrating their navigational “map” as magnetic and environmental conditions slowly change.
In general, migrants cope with weather by sensing winds aloft and adjusting flight strategy, by using multiple redundant cues (so that loss of one cue doesn’t cause total disorientation), and by making use of stopover habitats when forced down. Nonetheless, extreme events (hurricanes, magnetic storms, cold snaps) can still cause large-scale mortality or delays in migration.

Anthropogenic Disturbances of Navigation
Human activities are increasingly perturbing the cues birds rely on. Urbanization and infrastructure generate light, noise, and electromagnetic fields that can confuse migratory birds.

Light pollution (ALAN): Artificial lights (streetlights, towers, advertising) disrupt nocturnal migrants. Bright city lights attract and disorient flying birds, causing them to circle or descend into urban areas, often leading to exhaustion or fatal collisions. On cloudy nights, light pollution is especially impactful because stars and moon are obscured; birds drawn off course by glow may miss their correct migratory headings. Even beyond attraction, ALAN can interfere with internal compasses. A recent systematic review notes that artificial light can disrupt all three primary orientation mechanisms (sun compass, star compass, and magnetic compass) ([Effects of artificial light on bird movement and distribution: a systematic map | Environmental Evidence | Full Text](https://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13750-021-00246-8#:~:text=particularly hormone levels and stress,9]. ALAN can)). For instance, certain wavelengths of streetlight can alter the sky’s polarization pattern, misleading the birds’ polarized-light compass. The net effect is higher mortality (building collisions) and navigational errors near urban areas.
Noise pollution: Anthropogenic noise (traffic, industrial, urban) can also affect migrating birds, though its impacts are less understood. Noise doesn’t directly scramble magnetic or visual compasses, but it can degrade stopover habitat quality. In one field experiment, broadcasting traffic noise in a natural stopover area caused a 25% drop in migrating bird abundance compared to a quiet control ([ An experimental investigation into the effects of traffic noise on distributions of birds: avoiding the phantom road - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3826227/#:~:text=conducted daily bird surveys along,at control sites—suggesting that traffic)). Some species simply avoided the noisy area. Migrants rely on stopover sites to rest and refuel; if noise makes a site inhospitable, migrants may skip it at the cost of more strenuous flight. Chronic noise might also disturb sleep or stress physiology during migration, indirectly affecting orientation. While few studies test noise effects on orientation cues per se, noise pollution clearly reduces habitat suitability along flyways, which can force migrants into suboptimal routes.
Electromagnetic pollution: Widespread radio-frequency (RF) sources in urban environments – cell towers, power lines, broadcast antennas – emit electromagnetic noise that can scramble the birds’ magnetic sensors. Controlled experiments show that even weak broadband noise (kHz–MHz range) prevents songbirds from using their magnetic compass ([Anthropogenic electromagnetic noise disrupts magnetic compass orientation in a migratory bird - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24805233/#::text=been widely accepted as scientifically,grounded huts%2C the birds again)). European robins exposed to ambient urban RF in a forest hut lost their ability to orient by the magnetic field; when the hut was RF-shielded, orientation returned ([Anthropogenic electromagnetic noise disrupts magnetic compass orientation in a migratory bird - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24805233/#:~:text=been
In summary, humans are increasingly altering the navigational landscape. Light pollution acts as a false beacon or mask for natural celestial cues ([Effects of artificial light on bird movement and distribution: a systematic map | Environmental Evidence | Full Text](https://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13750-021-00246-8#:~:text=particularly hormone levels and stress,9]. ALAN can)); noise pollution degrades stopover habitat and can interfere with cues like infrasound; and electromagnetic “noise” directly corrupts the magnetic sense ([Anthropogenic electromagnetic noise disrupts magnetic compass orientation in a migratory bird - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24805233/#:~:text=been widely accepted as scientifically,grounded huts%2C the birds again)). These anthropogenic disruptions have raised conservation concerns, as even small orientation errors can accumulate to large displacements. Ongoing research is documenting how artificial cues (e.g. particular light wavelengths, cell tower frequencies) affect different species, with the goal of mitigating impacts (e.g. using bird-safe lighting spectra, shielding critical corridors).
