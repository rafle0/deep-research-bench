Horizontal Gene Transfer in Plants and Animals: A Comprehensive Analysis
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT)—the movement of genetic material between distantly related organisms by non-reproductive means—has long been recognized as a major evolutionary force in microbes. In bacteria, HGT via transformation, conjugation, or phage-mediated transduction is common, driving adaptations such as antibiotic resistance. By contrast, HGT in complex eukaryotes (plants and animals) was historically thought to be extremely rare due to biological barriers (sequestered germlines, developmental complexity, etc.) ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=Horizontal gene transfer ,and mismatch between the niche)). However, growing genomic evidence reveals that HGT does occur in plants and animals, sometimes with significant adaptive consequences ([Aphids got their colours by stealing genes from fungi](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/aphids-got-their-colours-by-stealing-genes-from-fungi#:~:text=These sorts of “horizontal gene,transfer their genes to humans)) ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=Recent estimates indicate that%2C although,using genes of fungal origin)). This report provides an in-depth analysis of known HGT instances in plants and animals, the mechanisms enabling such transfers, their evolutionary significance, comparisons with microbial HGT, and recent insights suggesting HGT in eukaryotes is more prevalent than previously believed. The analysis is organized into clear sections with case studies, and summary tables highlight major examples, mechanisms, and outcomes.

Known Instances of HGT in Plants
Plants, though rooted and immobile, are not immune to gene influx from outside sources. Several well-documented cases of HGT in plant genomes have emerged, spanning transfers from bacteria to plants and even between plant species. Intimate biological associations—such as parasitism or symbiosis—often underlie these transfers, providing a bridge for foreign DNA to integrate into plant cells ([Horizontal transfer of expressed genes in a parasitic flowering plant | BMC Genomics | Full Text](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-227#:~:text=Recent studies have shown that,has been undertaken in parasitic)). Below we discuss notable instances of HGT in plants:

Natural transgenesis in Sweet Potato: Perhaps the most famous example of bacteria-to-plant gene transfer is the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). Researchers discovered that cultivated sweet potato varieties contain Agrobacterium “T-DNA” sequences stably integrated in their genomes (The genome of cultivated sweet potato contains Agrobacterium T-DNAs with expressed genes: An example of a naturally transgenic food crop - PubMed) ([The genome of cultivated sweet potato contains Agrobacterium T-DNAs with expressed genes: An example of a naturally transgenic food crop - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25902487/#:~:text=sequences homologous to T,to contain four open reading)). Two distinct T-DNA regions (termed IbT-DNA1 and IbT-DNA2) were identified, carrying genes highly similar to Agrobacterium genes involved in hormone synthesis (e.g. iaaM, iaaH) and other functions ([The genome of cultivated sweet potato contains Agrobacterium T-DNAs with expressed genes: An example of a naturally transgenic food crop - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25902487/#:~:text=frames ,the current consumer distrust of)) ([The genome of cultivated sweet potato contains Agrobacterium T-DNAs with expressed genes: An example of a naturally transgenic food crop - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25902487/#:~:text=cultigens examined%2C but not in,safety of transgenic food crops)). These foreign genes are expressed in sweet potato tissues ([The genome of cultivated sweet potato contains Agrobacterium T-DNAs with expressed genes: An example of a naturally transgenic food crop - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25902487/#:~:text=sequences
Host-to-parasite gene transfer in *Rafflesia*: Parasitic plants that directly attach to and infiltrate host tissues are prime candidates for HGT. Rafflesia, a genus of holoparasitic flowering plants (known for the world’s largest blooms), steals more than just nutrients from its host grapevine (Tetrastigma). Transcriptome analyses of Rafflesia cantleyi revealed it has acquired dozens of nuclear genes from its host, with those genes being actively transcribed in the parasite ([Horizontal transfer of expressed genes in a parasitic flowering plant | BMC Genomics | Full Text](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-227#:~:text=We analyzed the transcriptomes of,than to its closest relatives)). These horizontally transferred genes (HGTs) in Rafflesia span various functions and show codon usage biases converging on the host’s patterns, indicating they have been functional in the parasite for a long time ([Horizontal transfer of expressed genes in a parasitic flowering plant | BMC Genomics | Full Text](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-227#:~:text=approaches,than to its closest relatives)) ([Horizontal transfer of expressed genes in a parasitic flowering plant | BMC Genomics | Full Text](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-227#:~:text=Our results establish for the,HGTs in these parasitic plants)). The gene transfers are unidirectional (host-to-parasite), presumably facilitated by the intimate physical connection via the haustorium (the parasitic organ that invades host tissue) ([Horizontal transfer of expressed genes in a parasitic flowering plant | BMC Genomics | Full Text](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-227#:~:text=Recent studies have shown that,has been undertaken in parasitic)). It is hypothesized that some host-derived genes may benefit Rafflesia by helping it evade host defenses or otherwise improve its parasitic efficiency ([Horizontal transfer of expressed genes in a parasitic flowering plant | BMC Genomics | Full Text](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-227#:~:text=Our
(Parasitic plants use stolen genes to make them better parasites | Penn State University) Figure 1: Field of dodder (*Cuscuta*, the yellow vine) parasitizing green host plants. Dodder is a parasitic plant that has acquired over a hundred functional genes from its hosts via HGT ([Parasitic plants use stolen genes to make them better parasites | Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/parasitic-plants-use-stolen-genes-make-them-better-parasites#:~:text=amount of genetic material from,in the journal Nature Plants)) ([Parasitic plants use stolen genes to make them better parasites | Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/parasitic-plants-use-stolen-genes-make-them-better-parasites#:~:text=The research team identified 108,in silencing host defense genes)). Intimate haustorial connections between parasite and host enable DNA transfer.

Massive gene theft in Dodder (*Cuscuta*): Another striking host-parasite example is dodder, a parasitic vine that wraps around other plants. A 2019 study revealed Cuscuta species have “stolen” over 100 functional genes from their host plants through HGT ([Parasitic plants use stolen genes to make them better parasites | Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/parasitic-plants-use-stolen-genes-make-them-better-parasites#:~:text=The parasitic plant dodder has,All Rights Reserved)) ([Parasitic plants use stolen genes to make them better parasites | Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/parasitic-plants-use-stolen-genes-make-them-better-parasites#:~:text=amount of genetic material from,in the journal Nature Plants)). These genes are not merely present; they are expressed and functional in dodder, contributing to key parasitic traits. Some stolen genes aid in forming the haustorium (the structure dodder uses to penetrate host vasculature) and in nutrient extraction, while one gene produces microRNA molecules that are sent back into the host as “genetic weapons” to silence host defense genes ([Parasitic plants use stolen genes to make them better parasites | Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/parasitic-plants-use-stolen-genes-make-them-better-parasites#:~:text=The
Plant-to-plant transfers aiding adaptation: HGT can also occur between free-living plants, not just in parasite-host pairs. An illuminating case is the transfer of a photoreceptor gene between plants that enabled a major ecological adaptation. Certain fern species acquired a gene called neochrome from hornworts (bryophyte plants) via horizontal transfer, dramatically improving the ferns’ shade tolerance ([Horizontal transfer of an adaptive chimeric photoreceptor from bryophytes to ferns - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24733898/#:~:text=Ferns are well known for,scale)) ([Horizontal transfer of an adaptive chimeric photoreceptor from bryophytes to ferns - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24733898/#:~:text=phylogenetic reconstructions of phototropin and,discovered a previously unidentified phototropin)). Neochrome is a chimeric photoreceptor that combines red-light and blue-light sensing in one protein, allowing ferns to optimize growth under low light (such as the forest understory). Phylogenetic analysis showed fern neochrome genes nested within hornwort gene lineages, and molecular clock estimates indicate the transfer happened 179 million years ago – long after ferns and hornworts had diverged ([Horizontal transfer of an adaptive chimeric photoreceptor from bryophytes to ferns - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24733898/#::text=responses,draft genome of the hornwort)) ([Horizontal transfer of an adaptive chimeric photoreceptor from bryophytes to ferns - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24733898/#:~:text=evidence for neochrome in hornworts,discovered a previously unidentified phototropin)). By picking up a fully-formed light-sensing gene from hornworts, ferns were able to thrive in dim environments under the canopy of angiosperms, an evolutionary boost that likely contributed to the diversification of modern ferns ([Horizontal transfer of an adaptive chimeric photoreceptor from bryophytes to ferns - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24733898/#:~:text=Ferns
Gene sharing among grasses: Recent research suggests that even non-parasitic flowering plants can exchange genes. For example, grasses in the genus Alloteropsis (some of which use C4 photosynthesis and others C3) have acquired key C4 photosynthesis genes from other grass species via lateral gene transfer ([Adaptive Evolution of C4 Photosynthesis through Recurrent Lateral ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221200084X#:~:text=,and adaptation in flowering plants)) (Adaptive Evolution of C4 Photosynthesis through Recurrent Lateral ...00084-X#::text=Adaptive Evolution of C4 Photosynthesis,has been a recurrent)). One study showed Alloteropsis grasses had laterally acquired versions of the enzyme PEPC (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase) that were already optimized for C4 function, whereas their own lineage’s versions were less efficient ([Lateral Gene Transfer Acts As an Evolutionary Shortcut to Efficient C4 Biochemistry - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32521019/#::text=mutations%2C and therefore extended periods,evolved the C4 trait much)) ([Lateral Gene Transfer Acts As an Evolutionary Shortcut to Efficient C4 Biochemistry - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32521019/#:~:text=earlier,catalytic efficiency and important changes)). By integrating these pre-adapted genes, Alloteropsis effectively bypassed some evolutionary steps in developing C4 physiology. This “evolutionary shortcut” via HGT provided an immediate functional advantage, illustrating that plant–plant HGT can drive major physiological innovations when the conditions allow gene transfer (the mechanism in this case is unclear, but natural root grafts or pollen transfer of DNA are possibilities being investigated).
Taken together, these examples overturn the notion that plant genomes are hermetically sealed against foreign genes. While rare on a generation-to-generation basis, plants can and do acquire genes horizontally – especially when facilitated by close contact (parasitism, grafting) or vectors (microbes). Importantly, the acquired genes in these cases are often adaptive: they enable parasitic life strategies, confer new metabolic capabilities, or open up ecological opportunities (e.g. thriving in low light or adopting C4 photosynthesis). Table 1 summarizes major HGT case studies in plants, including the donor sources, inferred mechanisms, and evolutionary outcomes.

Known Instances of HGT in Animals
For animals, HGT was long deemed even more unlikely than in plants, due to their segregated germline and lack of processes like pollination or grafting. Yet genomic studies have unveiled multiple instances of horizontal acquisitions in animals, from invertebrates to even humans. These transfers often involve microbial genes integrating into animal genomes, sometimes endowing the recipient with entirely new biochemical abilities. In other cases, the source is a plant or virus. Below, we explore prominent examples of HGT in animals and their significance:

(The Colorful Secret Of The Pea Aphid : NPR) Figure 2: Red and green pea aphids on a plant stem. Pea aphids acquired fungal genes for carotenoid biosynthesis, allowing them to produce red-orange pigments themselves ([Lateral transfer of genes from fungi underlies carotenoid production in aphids - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20431015/#:~:text=Carotenoids are colored compounds produced,kilobase region%2C encoding)) ([Lateral transfer of genes from fungi underlies carotenoid production in aphids - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20431015/#:~:text=in red individuals,that make their own carotenoids)). The HGT-derived pigments underlie a color polymorphism (red vs green) that affects aphid interactions with predators and parasitoids ([Aphids got their colours by stealing genes from fungi](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/aphids-got-their-colours-by-stealing-genes-from-fungi#:~:text=In most of these cases%2C,doing so%2C shaping its evolution)).

Fungal carotenoid genes in insects (Aphids & others): A landmark discovery in 2010 showed that the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) possesses genes for carotenoid biosynthesis that originated from fungi ([Lateral transfer of genes from fungi underlies carotenoid production in aphids - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20431015/#:~:text=Carotenoids are colored compounds produced,kilobase region%2C encoding)) ([Lateral transfer of genes from fungi underlies carotenoid production in aphids - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20431015/#:~:text=in red individuals,that make their own carotenoids)). Carotenoids (pigments used in vision, coloration, and antioxidant defense) are normally absent from animal genomes – most animals must obtain them from their diet. Pea aphids, however, can make their own carotenoids, and this is due to an ancestral HGT event where fungal genes (for enzymes like carotenoid desaturases) entered the aphid genome and became heritable ([Lateral transfer of genes from fungi underlies carotenoid production in aphids - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20431015/#:~:text=Carotenoids
Bacterial digestive enzymes in insects (Coffee berry borer beetle): HGT can equip animals with enzymes to exploit new food sources. The coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei), a beetle pest that feeds exclusively on coffee seeds, was found to harbor a gene (HhMAN1) of clear bacterial origin that encodes a mannanase enzyme ([Adaptive horizontal transfer of a bacterial gene to an invasive insect pest of coffee - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22371593/#:~:text=Horizontal gene transfer ,widespread in a broad biogeographic)) (Adaptive horizontal transfer of a bacterial gene to an invasive insect pest of coffee - PubMed.

Plant detoxification gene in Whitefly: In an unusual twist, a gene has jumped from plant to insect to aid the insect in overcoming plant defenses. The silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), a sap-sucking pest, acquired a plant gene encoding a phenolic glucoside malonyltransferase (now called BtPMaT1) via HGT ([Whitefly hijacks a plant detoxification gene that neutralizes plant toxins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421001641#:~:text=toxins www,whiteflies to neutralize phenolic glucosides)) ([Whitefly hijacks a plant detoxification gene that neutralizes plant ...](https://plantae.org/whitefly-hijacks-a-plant-detoxification-gene-that-neutralizes-plant-toxins-cell/#:~:text=,the plant's own defense mechanism)). This enzyme enables whiteflies to chemically disarm toxic phenolic glycosides that many plants produce as anti-herbivore compounds. In essence, the whitefly stole a gene from its host plants’ own detoxification toolkit, allowing it to neutralize the plant’s chemical defenses ([Whitefly hijacks a plant detoxification gene that neutralizes plant toxins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421001641#:~:text=toxins
Cell-wall-degrading enzymes in nematodes: Plant-parasitic nematodes have also acquired genes to exploit plant hosts. Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) cause galling disease in many crops, and their ability to invade plant roots is aided by enzymes like pectinases and cellulases that break down the plant cell wall. These enzymes are not native to animals; comparative genomics indicates nematodes acquired them from soil bacteria or fungi via HGT ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=horizontal transfer of single genes,at the evolution of eukaryotes)) ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=allowed the emergence of plant,at the evolution of eukaryotes)). Multiple horizontal transfers of genes for plant cell wall degradation and defense modulation occurred during nematode evolution, which were pivotal for the emergence of plant parasitism in these worms ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=modulation of plant defence ,at the evolution of eukaryotes)). For example, genes coding for pectate lyases in Meloidogyne have closest relatives in bacteria, not other animals. The acquired enzymes allow nematodes to soften plant cell walls and infect roots, a clear adaptive benefit ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=horizontal
Endosymbiont gene transfer (Wolbachia to insects): Many insects carry bacterial endosymbionts, and sometimes fragments of endosymbiont DNA make their way into the host genome. An extreme example is the fruit fly Drosophila ananassae, whose genome contains almost the entire genome of a Wolbachia bacterium integrated into one of its chromosomes ([HGT is widespread in insects and contributes to male courtship in ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742200719X#:~:text=HGT is widespread in insects,Hotopp et)). This likely resulted from an infection where bacterial DNA accidentally got copied into the germline. Although most such insertions are nonfunctional “genetic fossils,” they demonstrate that intimate symbioses can blur genomic boundaries. In some cases, individual Wolbachia genes in hosts have been co-opted for host functions (though clear examples of functional co-option are still being studied). The sheer extent of Wolbachia DNA found in insects (one survey found that most “foreign” DNA in insect genomes is from Wolbachia ([Horizontal gene transfers in insects - ScienceDirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214574515000371#:~:text=Horizontal gene transfers in insects,functional in))) suggests that endosymbiont-to-host HGT is relatively frequent on an evolutionary timescale, even if functional retention of these genes is rarer. This phenomenon mirrors the ancient endosymbiotic gene transfers that gave rise to mitochondria and chloroplasts – albeit on a more recent and smaller scale.
Viral gene co-option in animals (Syncytin in mammals): Animals have also acquired genes from viruses that proved evolutionarily invaluable. A salient case is the syncytin genes in placental mammals, which were originally envelope genes of retroviruses that infected germline cells. These viral genes, once “domesticated” by the host, now encode fusogenic proteins that help form the placental cell layer (syncytiotrophoblast) by fusing cells together (Syncytin-Opo1 is a fusogenic retroviral Env protein. (A) Schematic... | Download Scientific Diagram) ([Syncytin-Opo1 is a fusogenic retroviral Env protein.

Table 2 (below) summarizes these and other representative HGT cases in animals, indicating the donor, mechanism, and adaptive significance in each case. From metabolic genes that broaden diet, to defensive genes that disarm host toxins, to developmental genes that enable new modes of life, these examples make clear that animal genomes are not as isolated as once thought.

Mechanisms are context-dependent (parasite-host contact, dietary uptake, endosymbiosis, viral infection). Each HGT event conferred a significant adaptive advantage, from new metabolic capabilities to novel developmental mechanisms.

Mechanisms Enabling HGT in Eukaryotes
Unlike bacteria, plants and animals lack dedicated systems to actively exchange DNA, so how do these cross-kingdom gene transfers occur? Research indicates that HGT in eukaryotes typically exploits unusual biological situations or intermediaries that circumvent the barriers to foreign DNA incorporation ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=Horizontal gene transfer ,and mismatch between the niche)) ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=Two major features of bdelloid,as a barrier to eukaryotic)). Key mechanisms include:

Parasitism and intimate symbiosis: Whenever one organism intimately associates with another (especially internally or via vascular connections), there is potential for DNA transfer. Parasitic plants (like Rafflesia and Cuscuta) form cellular bridges (haustoria) with their hosts; through these connections, not only nutrients but also macromolecules (even mRNA or DNA) can occasionally flow ([Horizontal transfer of expressed genes in a parasitic flowering plant | BMC Genomics | Full Text](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-227#:~:text=Recent studies have shown that,has been undertaken in parasitic)). If fragments of host DNA enter parasite cells and integrate into the germline, HGT is achieved. The host-to-parasite gene transfers in plants are strongly correlated with the degree of parasitic intimacy – obligate holoparasites show higher HGT incidence than less integrated parasites ([Genomic reconfiguration in parasitic plants involves considerable ...](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8260112/#:~:text=Horizontal gene transfers are more,potentially bringing about functional advantages)). Similarly, intracellular endosymbionts or pathogens can mediate HGT to animals. For example, Wolbachia bacteria live inside insect germ cells and have at times left pieces of their genome behind in the host chromosome ([Horizontal gene transfers in insects - ScienceDirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214574515000371#:~:text=Horizontal gene transfers in insects,functional in)). Parasitic wasps harbor polydnaviruses that carry wasp genes into caterpillar hosts (though those genes don’t integrate into the caterpillar germline, they illustrate vectoring of DNA). Overall, parasitism blurs species boundaries and can “ferry” DNA from one organism to another.
Vectors such as Viruses and Transposons: Viruses are natural genetic shuttles that can package and deliver genes between host organisms. Retroviruses in particular integrate into host genomes as part of their life cycle; if a retrovirus carrying host DNA infects a different species and integrates, it can deposit that DNA in the new genome. This mechanism is believed to underlie some plant-to-insect transfers (a plant virus might encapsidate a piece of plant mRNA which then recombines into an insect genome during infection) and has clearly occurred in the case of retroviral genes like syncytin moving into mammals. In plants, Agrobacterium (though a bacterium, acts like a virus by transferring DNA) is a well-known vector, as seen in sweet potato’s T-DNAs (The genome of cultivated sweet potato contains Agrobacterium T-DNAs with expressed genes: An example of a naturally transgenic food crop - PubMed) ([The genome of cultivated sweet potato contains Agrobacterium T-DNAs with expressed genes: An example of a naturally transgenic food crop - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25902487/#:~:text=sequences homologous to T,to contain four open reading)). Transposable elements (transposons) are another vehicle: some DNA transposons can cut and paste between genomes. There are documented cases of transposons moving between insect species (“space invader” elements jumping across insect taxa ([Aphids got their colours by stealing genes from fungi](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/aphids-got-their-colours-by-stealing-genes-from-fungi#:~:text=These sorts of “horizontal gene,transfer their genes to humans))), contributing to genomic innovation (or instability). These vectors are relatively rare but potent means to bypass reproduction – effectively nature’s genetic engineers.
Cellular Fusion or Organelle Capture: In plants, grafting (either natural or artificial) can result in cells of one plant fusing or exchanging organelles with another. Experiments have shown that whole plastid genomes (and even nuclear DNA) can move across a graft junction between two plant species ([ Horizontal genome transfer by cell-to-cell travel of whole organelles - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7775762/#:~:text=Recent work has revealed that,amoeboid plastids move into neighboring)) ([ Horizontal genome transfer by cell-to-cell travel of whole organelles - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7775762/#:~:text=mechanisms of genome transfer between,framework for horizontal genome transfer)). The mechanism involves dedifferentiation of cells at the graft site, formation of intercellular bridges, and migration of organelles or nuclei between cells ([ Horizontal genome transfer by cell-to-cell travel of whole organelles - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7775762/#:~:text=mechanisms
Environmental DNA uptake during stress: Some microscopic animals can take up DNA directly from their environment under special conditions. Bdelloid rotifers are an example – these tiny invertebrates can survive desiccation by suspending metabolism, during which their DNA breaks into pieces. Upon rehydration, their cells become leaky and DNA repair mechanisms are highly active, creating an opportunity for foreign DNA present in the environment (e.g., from ingested debris or co-occurring microbes) to slip into their genome as it is reassembled ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=Two major features of bdelloid,as a barrier to eukaryotic)). Rotifers show significantly higher HGT in species that experience frequent desiccation, supporting this mechanism ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=of 12,desiccating species)) (Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text). Although this is a unique case, it demonstrates that under the right circumstances (membrane damage, DNA repair), even a multicellular organism can acquire genes from free DNA in its surroundings – effectively a form of “natural transformation” analogous to bacteria taking up naked DNA.
Recurrent horizontal transfer via reproduction: While not a mechanism per se for initial transfer, one reason HGTs persist is if they become incorporated into germline DNA and passed vertically to offspring once acquired. In parasites, any germline integration means all descendants inherit the gene. In hybridizing species or allopolyploids (especially in plants), a species can suddenly gain genes from a related species by merging genomes. Some researchers broaden the HGT definition to include such gene flow between species via hybridization (though that blurs into introgression). True HGT implies a non-mating transfer, but subsequent hybridization can further spread an HGT-derived gene across species boundaries.
Mechanistically, eukaryotic HGT often requires surmounting multiple barriers: physical separation of germ cells, genomic incompatibilities (introns, promoters, codon usage), and immune defenses against foreign DNA. Thus, successful transfers are skewed toward scenarios that naturally overcome these barriers (as listed above). Indeed, studies find HGT events in eukaryotes are enriched in organisms with unusual life histories: parasites, symbiont hosts, asexual or desiccation-tolerant species ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=Two major features of bdelloid,as a barrier to eukaryotic)) ([Horizontal transfer of expressed genes in a parasitic flowering plant | BMC Genomics | Full Text](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-227#:~:text=Recent studies have shown that,has been undertaken in parasitic)). Once foreign DNA integrates and if it is not deleterious, it can be retained by drift; if it confers a benefit, natural selection can rapidly spread the gene in the population.

Evolutionary Significance of HGT in Plants and Animals
Each instance of HGT in plants and animals carries an evolutionary story. While initially considered freak occurrences, these transfers can profoundly influence the trajectory of a lineage by injecting ready-made genetic variation. The evolutionary significance of HGT in eukaryotes includes:

Instant Novel Functions: HGT provides a shortcut to new traits that might be difficult or slow to evolve through gradual mutation. The fern neochrome example shows an “adaptive leap” – acquiring a complex light-sensing gene in one step gave ferns an edge in low-light niches ([Horizontal transfer of an adaptive chimeric photoreceptor from bryophytes to ferns - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24733898/#:~:text=Ferns are well known for,scale)) ([Horizontal transfer of an adaptive chimeric photoreceptor from bryophytes to ferns - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24733898/#:~:text=phylogenetic reconstructions of phototropin and,discovered a previously unidentified phototropin)). Similarly, aphids gaining carotenoid genes instantly broke the dietary rule that constrained other animals ([Lateral transfer of genes from fungi underlies carotenoid production in aphids - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20431015/#:~:text=Carotenoids are colored compounds produced,kilobase region%2C encoding)) ([Lateral transfer of genes from fungi underlies carotenoid production in aphids - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20431015/#:~:text=in red individuals,that make their own carotenoids)), and nematodes acquiring cell wall enzymes instantly enabled a parasitic lifestyle ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=allowed the emergence of plant,at the evolution of eukaryotes)). Such leaps can open new ecological opportunities (new food sources, habitats, or behaviors), potentially leading to adaptive radiation. In essence, HGT is a source of “ready-made innovation” – rather than inventing a tool, an organism finds one in the genetic “toolbox” of another species and adopts it.
Adaptive Coevolution and Arms Races: HGT can fuel one side of a coevolutionary arms race by importing genetic weapons or countermeasures from a third party. The dodder and whitefly cases are illustrative: dodder parasites took in host genes that improve parasitism ([Parasitic plants use stolen genes to make them better parasites | Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/parasitic-plants-use-stolen-genes-make-them-better-parasites#:~:text=The research team identified 108,in silencing host defense genes)), and whiteflies took in plant genes that disarm host defenses ([Whitefly hijacks a plant detoxification gene that neutralizes plant ...](https://plantae.org/whitefly-hijacks-a-plant-detoxification-gene-that-neutralizes-plant-toxins-cell/#:~:text=,the plant's own defense mechanism)). These transfers tip the scale in favor of the parasite/herbivore, at least until hosts evolve new defenses. HGT thus contributes to the dynamic Red Queen interactions in ecosystems, where an organism might leap ahead by borrowing a gene already honed in another species. This kind of advantage can be so strong that it gets fixed in the population (as seen with BtPMaT1 in virtually all whiteflies, or iaaM/iaaH in all cultivated sweet potatoes).
Increasing Evolutionary Complexity: In some cases, HGT has enabled entirely new forms of complexity. The incorporation of viral genes into vertebrate genomes (e.g. syncytins for placentation) is an example where HGT was integral to a major evolutionary transition, contributing to the rise of mammals with intimate maternal-fetal interaction ([Syncytin-Opo1 is a fusogenic retroviral Env protein. (A) Schematic... | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Syncytin-Opo1-is-a-fusogenic-retroviral-Env-protein-A-Schematic-representation-of-the_fig3_271334854#:~:text=Syncytins are envelope genes of,not the receptor for SynB)). Other viral HGTs in animals have given rise to novel regulatory networks and possibly even new cell types (research has suggested certain gene regulators in the human brain may derive from ancient viruses). While such effects are rare, they underscore that HGT isn’t only about minor metabolic tweaks – it can facilitate big leaps in complexity or life-history strategy.
Genomic Mosaicism and Introgression: On a broader scale, HGT makes the tree of life more network-like. Especially in plants, where hybridization and HGT via parasitism occur, genomes can be mosaics of multiple ancestries. For instance, the Amborella plant’s mitochondrial genome contains horizontal inserts from numerous other plant species, reflecting a history of mitochondrial HGT in a scavenger-like fashion ([Horizontal transfer of expressed genes in a parasitic flowering plant | BMC Genomics | Full Text](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-227#:~:text=Recent studies have shown that,No)). Although those particular transfers might be neutral, they show how genetic material can diffuse across species boundaries, contributing to genetic diversity. In animals like bdelloid rotifers, a substantial fraction of the genome is foreign, which challenges our definition of what is “rotifer” DNA versus microbial DNA ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=initial discovery of inter,on the presence of these)) ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=Two major features of bdelloid,as a barrier to eukaryotic)). Evolutionarily, this implies natural selection can act on a broader genetic repertoire than just what arises from traditional vertical descent.
Contributions to Adaptation vs. Neutral Baggage: It’s worth noting that not every HGT leads to a beneficial outcome; many may be neutral or even slightly deleterious but persist due to linkage or lack of strong purifying selection. However, the examples we highlight have been identified precisely because they do contribute to adaptation or fitness. In genomic studies of HGT, researchers often find many foreign genes of unknown function – some may be neutral hitchhikers, genomic “fossils” that tell of past encounters even if they no longer serve a role ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#:~:text=“There were horizontal gene transfer,Shen said)) ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#:~:text=
In summary, HGT in eukaryotes acts as a sporadic but important source of novel genetic material. It has contributed to adaptations (metabolic, defensive, physiological) that might not have been readily achievable via gradual evolution, thereby shaping the evolution and ecology of the recipient lineages. Each confirmed case of adaptive HGT invites a reevaluation of how that lineage succeeded or changed – often, a single gene made all the difference.

HGT in Eukaryotes vs. HGT in Microbes: A Comparison
While HGT occurs in both eukaryotes and microbes, there are stark differences in frequency, scale, and mechanisms, as well as interesting parallels:

Frequency and Scale: In prokaryotes, HGT is extremely frequent and is a dominant mode of evolution. Bacteria can exchange plasmids carrying dozens of genes in one conjugation event, or acquire large genomic islands via phages, leading to rapid trait acquisition (e.g. antibiotic resistance clusters, toxin gene cassettes). In multicellular eukaryotes, HGT events are infrequent and typically involve one or a few genes at a time ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#:~:text=shaping prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes,and adaptation to environmental changes)) ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#:~:text=1%2C410 genes exhibiting diverse functions,and adaptation to environmental changes)). A bacterium might receive 10,000 base pairs of DNA and incorporate it overnight; a plant or animal may pick up a similar amount of foreign DNA once in a million years of evolution. The insect genome survey found an average of 6.5 genes acquired per insect species over their evolutionary history ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#::text=shaping
Mechanisms and Barriers: Bacteria possess specialized mechanisms for gene transfer (pili for conjugation, competence for transformation, viruses for transduction). They also lack a segregated germline – any cell can pass DNA to offspring during fission – making HGT straightforward. In contrast, eukaryotes have multiple barriers: somatic cells don’t usually transmit genes to the next generation, so the foreign DNA must reach cells that become eggs or sperm ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=and single,and mismatch between the niche)). Complex development means foreign genes must be properly regulated (promoters active, protein targeting signals correct, etc.) to be useful and not harmful ([Horizontal gene transfer in bdelloid rotifers is ancient, ongoing and more frequent in species from desiccating habitats | BMC Biology | Full Text](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0202-9#:~:text=and
Genetic Impact: In bacteria, HGT often transfers fully functional operons or pathways (like a multi-gene cluster for metabolizing a compound), because bacteria can afford to pick up a chunk of DNA and express it directly. Eukaryotes usually acquire single genes rather than whole pathways (with some exceptions like plant mitochondrial genome transfers). Therefore, eukaryotic HGT usually supplements or tweaks existing biology (one enzyme added to a pathway, one protein that enhances a structure) rather than wholesale introducing a new metabolic network. The whitefly, despite gaining 49 genes, still mostly gained single-gene functions that augment its existing capabilities (detoxification, digestion) ([An insect pest acquires multiple plant genes](https://phys.org/news/2022-10-insect-pest-multiple-genes.html#:~:text=The researchers' results also show,go back several million years)). By contrast, a bacterium can acquire a plasmid and suddenly gain the ability to conjugate and make a pilus, metabolize a novel substrate, and resist multiple antibiotics all at once. So, the magnitude of change from one HGT event is generally larger in microbes. However, over long timescales, eukaryotes have had massive HGT-like events too (the endosymbiosis events that gave them organelles were effectively giant HGT events that have since been assimilated).
Phylogenetic implications: Microbial phylogenies often resemble a web due to rampant HGT – genes might have very different histories from the species that carry them. In contrast, plant and animal phylogenies are mostly tree-like, with HGT as occasional branches grafting in. This means that for most genes in eukaryotes, vertical inheritance is intact and speciation is the main driver of diversification. HGT in eukaryotes creates intriguing exceptions – e.g. a plant may have one gene more closely related to that in a distant species than to its relatives. These anomalies can actually be clues to discover HGT events (as was done for parasitic plants where odd phylogenetic placement of some genes tipped off researchers to horizontal transfer ([Horizontal transfer of expressed genes in a parasitic flowering plant | BMC Genomics | Full Text](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-227#:~:text=Recent studies have shown that,has been undertaken in parasitic))).
Detection and Confirmation: In microbes, identifying HGT is often straightforward (atypical GC content, known mobile elements, etc.), and experiments can validate gene transfer (e.g. mating experiments). In eukaryotes, detecting HGT requires careful phylogenetic analysis to rule out convergence or ancient paralogy, and there is always a risk of false positives due to contamination in sequencing data (this was an issue in early claims of massive HGT in the tardigrade genome, which turned out to largely be contamination). As genomic data quality improves and more genomes are sequenced, confidence in eukaryotic HGT detection has grown. The 2022 insect study systematically filtered out contamination and lineage sorting issues to build a robust set of HGT genes ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#:~:text=In new research%2C a team,and adaptation to environmental changes)) ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#:~:text=With these data%2C they were,horizontal gene transfer in insects)). Hence, our understanding of HGT in eukaryotes is catching up to reality only now that tools allow distinguishing true horizontal acquisitions from noise.
Role in Adaptation: Both in microbes and in eukaryotes, HGT serves as a mechanism for rapid adaptation. In bacteria, this often manifests in sharing antibiotic resistance or virulence factors – short term, ecologically crucial traits. In plants and animals, the adaptive HGT events we see often pertain to nutrition (enzymes to eat new food), stress tolerance, or interaction with other organisms (defense/offense in biotic interactions). A common thread is that HGT tends to spread genes that help organisms survive new challenges or environments. Another similarity is that in both, if an HGT is beneficial, it can spread vertically after acquisition. We see parallel examples: a plasmid with antibiotic resistance spreads through bacterial populations, whereas a new gene in an insect spreads through the species (all moths and butterflies now carry a bacterial gene that influences their reproduction ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#:~:text=“LOC105383139 was horizontally introduced into,bacterial genus Listeria%2C” they said)) ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#:~:text=In
In summary, microbial HGT is like frequent gene “trading” in a global market, whereas eukaryotic HGT is more akin to rare serendipitous “gifts” or acquisitions that occasionally have profound effects on the recipient. Eukaryotes lack the ease and ubiquity of horizontal exchange seen in microbes, but as we continue to discover, they are far from HGT-proof. The underlying principles – DNA mobility, selection acting on useful genes – unite the phenomena across the tree of life, even if the dynamics differ.

Recent Research and Expanding Knowledge of Eukaryotic HGT
Our perception of HGT in plants and animals has shifted dramatically in light of recent research. Previously, only a handful of controversial examples existed, but the genomic era has uncovered many instances and even performed large-scale surveys:

Genome-wide scans in diverse species: As more plant and animal genomes have been sequenced (often with high accuracy), researchers started noticing foreign-looking genes. For example, a 2022 comprehensive screen of 218 insect genomes found a total of 1,410 genes acquired via 741 distinct HGT events from non-animals ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#:~:text=shaping prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes,and adaptation to environmental changes)) ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#:~:text=1%2C410 genes exhibiting diverse functions,and adaptation to environmental changes)). These horizontally acquired genes were not random filler; many have been retained over evolutionary time and appear to contribute to functions in mating behavior, nutrition, growth, and adaptation ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#:~:text=shaping
Recognition of more HGT “hotspots”: We now recognize certain groups as HGT hotspots: parasitic plants, herbivorous insects, asexual micro-animals, endosymbiont-hosting insects, etc., as discussed. Even within a genome, organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts) are hotspots for HGT, especially in plants. Plant mitochondrial genomes can incorporate large fragments from other species’ mitochondria when two plants come into contact (through root grafts or parasitism) ([Mitochondrial Phylogenomics of Cuscuta (Convolvulaceae) Reveals ...](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/14/6/evac091/6608377#:~:text=Mitochondrial Phylogenomics of Cuscuta ,transferred in this fashion)). Amborella’s mitochondrial genome famously contains entire genomic segments from at least three other plant species ([Horizontal transfer of expressed genes in a parasitic flowering plant | BMC Genomics | Full Text](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-227#:~:text=order Malpighiales ,the parasites)) ([Horizontal transfer of expressed genes in a parasitic flowering plant | BMC Genomics | Full Text](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-227#:~:text=opportunities to study HGT in,from vertically inherited gene regions)). While these may not all be functional, they show how permeable certain compartments can be. In animal mitochondria, HGT is less common (since animals don’t often merge cells), but there are cases in unicellular eukaryotes and some evidence in certain bivalve clams of mtDNA introgression. Overall, the more we look, the more we find that genomes are not isolated islands – genes have moved between species more often than the older textbooks claimed.
Changing attitudes and models: The accumulation of examples has led evolutionary biologists to adjust models of genome evolution to include rare horizontal inputs. There’s greater openness to HGT as an explanation when a gene tree conflicts with an organism tree. For instance, what might have been written off as gene loss or convergence might actually be an HGT event. The mindset has shifted from “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence” to “unusual gene origin? Let’s test if HGT happened.” Many recent studies emphasize rigorous validation – e.g. ruling out contamination, ensuring the foreign gene is truly embedded in the host genome and passed through generations. The tardigrade genome controversy (initially thought to be ~17% foreign, later largely refuted as contamination) was a learning moment that led to stricter methods. As a result, the current catalog of eukaryote HGTs is more reliable and likely still growing.
Are HGTs more common than thought? In light of new evidence, the answer appears to be yes – HGT in eukaryotes is more common (though not nearly as commonplace as in microbes) than scientists thought a few decades ago. For example, before 2000, one would struggle to list any clear HGT in animals; now we have multiple in insects alone. A 2015 study even suggested humans have a few dozen genes of possible horizontal origin (mostly from bacteria), though many of those are ancient and debated. The prevailing view is that multicellular eukaryotes likely undergo sporadic HGT over long timescales, so that if you examine deep evolutionary history, nearly every lineage will have a handful of genes from HGT. Indeed, one analysis proposed that up to 1% of genes in the average invertebrate genome might be traceable to foreign sources (Recombination in bdelloid rotifer genomes: asexuality, transfer and ...00028-3#:~:text=... www.cell.com Around 10,consequences of high horizontal)). With improved detection, we might find, for instance, that certain stress tolerance genes in plants, or nutrition-related genes in animals, have unsuspected external origins.
Functional confirmation lagging: While identification of HGT genes is accelerating, confirming their function lags behind. It’s one thing to spot a suspicious gene and quite another to demonstrate its contribution to the organism. The best-understood cases remain those where the phenotype is obvious (color in aphids, digestion in beetles, etc.) or where experimental manipulation is feasible (knockouts in insects or plants as done for whiteflies and moths ([Insects Carry 1,410 Horizontally-Transferred Microbial Genes: Study | Sci.News](https://www.sci.news/biology/insects-horizontally-transferred-microbial-genes-11011.html#:~:text=“This gene has persisted in,”))). Many HGT genes found in surveys are of unknown function; future research needs to elucidate whether they provide subtle advantages (perhaps under certain conditions) or if they are neutral remnants. The Penn State study on dodder was a step forward, as it linked many acquired genes to parasitic structures and even cross-species gene silencing ([Parasitic plants use stolen genes to make them better parasites | Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/parasitic-plants-use-stolen-genes-make-them-better-parasites#:~:text=The research team identified 108,in silencing host defense genes)). We can expect more such integrative studies that tie genomic data to ecological and physiological roles, solidifying our understanding of how foreign genes become integrated into organismal biology.
Technology’s role: Advanced sequencing (long-read, single-cell) and phylogenomic tools have made it easier to detect HGT and rule out artifacts. Additionally, as genome editing (CRISPR, etc.) becomes common in non-model organisms, researchers can experimentally test the importance of HGT genes (e.g., by knocking out an HGT gene and seeing if the organism loses some capability). This will likely lead to more breakthroughs in connecting HGT genes to adaptive traits. Furthermore, metagenomic sequencing sometimes catches gene transfer in action (for instance, finding a virus with host genes or a plant with bits of a parasite’s DNA). Such evidence can directly demonstrate transfer events rather than just infer ancient ones.
In conclusion, recent research underscores that horizontal gene transfer, while not an everyday occurrence in plants and animals, has nonetheless been a consistent thread in their evolution. It is more common than previously appreciated, particularly in certain ecological contexts, and its contributions to adaptation are increasingly documented. We now view genomes as dynamic tapestries that occasionally incorporate foreign threads – threads that can become tightly woven into the fabric of life’s diversity. As the field progresses, we can expect to discover even more surprising gene sharing stories across the tree of life, reshaping our understanding of how organisms acquire the traits that let them survive and thrive. Each new finding of HGT in a plant or animal serves as a reminder that innovation in evolution sometimes comes not just from within, but from without – by borrowing a page from another genome’s book.
