Price Dynamics of Pacific Chub Mackerel (2015–2025) in Pacific Rim Markets and Environmental Linkages
Introduction
Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus), also known as Pacific chub mackerel, is a small pelagic fish of high commercial importance across the Pacific Rim. Major fisheries and markets exist in Japan, South Korea, China, the United States (primarily the U.S. West Coast), and Chile. Over the past decade, chub mackerel populations and market prices have experienced notable fluctuations. These changes are not only driven by fishing pressure and market demand but also by biological factors (e.g. changes in fish size and abundance) and oceanographic conditions. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of price trends in key Pacific Rim markets, interannual variations in mackerel size (weight and length), and the influence of environmental indicators – such as sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, El Niño/La Niña events, and upwelling – on the observed biological and economic patterns. Data have been drawn from fishery agency reports, scientific studies, and market analyses, with an emphasis on primary research and official statistics. The goal is to identify correlations between environmental changes and the biological/economic trends in chub mackerel fisheries.

Market Price Trends in Pacific Rim Countries (2015–2025)
Chub mackerel prices have varied widely across regions and years, reflecting shifts in supply and demand. Table 1 summarizes representative price indicators for chub mackerel in the five major Pacific Rim markets at select points over the last 10 years. All prices are given in approximate USD per kilogram for comparability:

Region	2015 Price (USD/kg) *	2020 Price (USD/kg) *	2024 Price (USD/kg) *	Notable Trends (2015–2025)
Japan	~$3–$5 (est.)	~$6–$12 (high in 2018–20)	$0.9–$8.2 (2024)	Highly volatile market with dramatic price swings from 2018-2024. Peak prices in 2018-2020 followed by significant price drops in 2024 as supply chain adjusted.
South Korea	~$2.00 (est.)	~$2.20 (2019)	~$2.66 (2025 Q1 imports)	Steady Rise: Domestic mackerel producer price index rose from 100 (2015 baseline) to 125.8 in 2023
China	~$1.5–$2.5 (est.)	~$3 (imported Atlantic)	~$2 (Pacific)	Growing Market: China views Pacific mackerel as a low-value product, mostly in food service. Domestic demand increased in late 2010s; imports of Atlantic mackerel (higher value) rose, but Pacific chub mackerel remains cheaper and abundant.
United States (West Coast)	~$0.15 (ex-vessel)**	~$0.20 (ex-vessel)**	~0.25 (ex-vessel)**	Stable & Low: U.S. Pacific mackerel is a lower-priced fish, often used for bait or canning. Ex-vessel prices are low (historically around 135/ton, i.e. 0.15/kg). Minimal domestic market fluctuations compared to Asia.
Chile	~$1.0–$1.5 (est.)	~$1.8 (peak ~2019)	~$1.2 (2024 est.)	Volatile Supply: Chile's chub mackerel (mostly bycatch of jack mackerel fishery) saw prices vary with El Niño cycles. Reduced catches post-2015 El Niño likely tightened supply, modestly boosting prices (local markets).
Notes: Price ranges/estimates are based on available data and reports; “est.” indicates estimated from context or related species if exact figure unavailable. Ex-vessel prices are first-sale prices at landing.

Japan: Japan is traditionally the largest producer and consumer of mackerel, and its market has seen dramatic swings. In the late 1970s, Japanese chub mackerel catches were at record highs (1.2 million tons in 1979) with low prices, but by the early 1990s catches crashed to ~0.22 million tons, causing prices to spike ([JAPAN'S MACKEREL MARKET](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/3018/noaa_3018_DS1.pdf?#::text=the landidg volume%3A the greater,Metric Tons) Exvessel Prices)) ([JAPAN'S MACKEREL MARKET](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/3018/noaa_3018_DS1.pdf?#:~:text=214%2C576 45 55 101 118,88 77 89 60)). Over the past decade, a similar inverse relationship between supply and price has been evident. After 2015, domestic catches remained below historical levels, and Japan even imposed tighter catch limits via the North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC) to protect the stock ([ Pelagics supply outlook improving ](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/Pelagics-supply-outlook-improving/en#:~:text=There are concerns about the,134 000 tonnes in 2015)). Limited supply pushed mackerel prices upward. By 2018, wholesale mackerel prices were on a clear upward trend ([ Stronger mackerel supplies, herring supplies slightly up in 2020 ](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/Stronger-mackerel-supplies-herring-supplies-slightly-up-in-2020/en#:~:text=percent increase in the TAC,North America are expected to)). Industry reports noted that 2018–2023 brought strong prices – in 2023, Japan’s wholesale price for frozen chub mackerel ranged roughly $4.4 to $18.5 per kg ([Frozen Mackerel Price in Japan | Tridge](https://dir.tridge.com/prices/frozen-mackerel/JP#:~:text=The wholesale price of Japan,supply for Japan Frozen Mackerel)) (Frozen Mackerel Price in Japan | Tridge), with higher end prices reflecting scarcity of quality fish. However, an interesting turn occurred in 2023–2024: sardine populations rebounded massively in Japanese waters, outcompeting mackerel. Sardines, being much cheaper, “supplanted more profitable mackerel”, leading to a 70% drop in mackerel catch in early 2023 ([Mackerel shortage, sardine bounty forcing sales strategy shift in Japan | SeafoodSource](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/premium/supply-trade/sardines-edge-out-more-profitable-mackerel-in-japanese-fisheries#:~:text=match at L135 “There are,”)). This supply crunch initially kept prices high. But by 2024, the market adjusted – possibly via increased imports of Atlantic mackerel and a temporary glut of frozen inventory – and Japan’s mackerel prices plummeted to new lows (down to $0.9–$8/kg in 2024) ([Frozen Mackerel Price in Japan | Tridge](https://dir.tridge.com/prices/frozen-mackerel/JP#::text=The

South Korea: South Korea is another major chub mackerel consumer, where the fish is a staple in diets. Korean mackerel prices have shown a generally rising trend in recent years. According to producer price indices, the price level for mackerel in Korea rose from an index of 110.6 in 2019 to 125.8 in 2023 ([South Korea: mackerel PPI 2023 | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1084026/south-korea-producer-price-index-mackerel/#:~:text=In 2023%2C the producer price,6 points in)) – roughly a 14% increase in real terms. This reflects strong domestic demand and perhaps increased costs. Korea both catches and imports mackerel; notably, imports have surged recently. In fact, mackerel import volume rose so much that media dubbed it “Mackerel Mania,” with import volumes up and import prices rising to $2.66/kg in Q1 2025, a 19% increase over the previous year ([Worldnews - Mackerel Mania: South Korea's Imports Skyrocket ...](https://seafood.media/fis/worldnews/worldnews.asp?monthyear=4-2025&day=9&id=134195&l=e&country=186&special=&ndb=1&df=0#:~:text=Worldnews ,increased import volumes%2C domestic)). Korean consumers favor mackerel for dishes like grilled mackerel, and supply shortfalls (due to fluctuating local catches) have led Korea to buy more from overseas. Through 2015–2020, Korean wholesale prices hovered around $2/kg, then climbed above $2.5/kg by the mid-2020s. In summary, South Korean mackerel prices have steadily increased over the past decade, reflecting growing demand and periodic shortages, though prices remain lower than in Japan’s high-value market.

China: China’s role in the chub mackerel trade has grown, primarily as an importer and re-exporter. Chinese consumers themselves historically did not consume as much mackerel as Japan or Korea (mackerel is often seen in Japanese cuisine), but this is changing. By 2019, China was consuming about 115,000 tons of mackerel annually, mostly Pacific chub mackerel ([ Stronger mackerel supplies, herring supplies slightly up in 2020 ](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/Stronger-mackerel-supplies-herring-supplies-slightly-up-in-2020/en#:~:text=About 95 percent of mackerel,Philippines fell by 44 percent)). Approximately 95% of mackerel in China is consumed through the food service industry (e.g. Japanese restaurants) ([ Stronger mackerel supplies, herring supplies slightly up in 2020 ](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/Stronger-mackerel-supplies-herring-supplies-slightly-up-in-2020/en#:~:text=About

United States: In the U.S., chub mackerel (Pacific mackerel) is managed on the West Coast, but it is a relatively small fishery and market compared to Asia. U.S. Pacific mackerel catches averaged on the order of a few tens of thousands of tons or less in recent years (often used for bait, pet food, or canned products). Prices in the U.S. domestic market have historically been very low – for example, in California’s fishery, Pacific mackerel ex-vessel prices in the late 1990s averaged only $135 per ton (about 0.13 per kg) ([[PDF] Status of the Pacific Mackerel Resource and Fishery in 1998](https://swfsc-publications.fisheries.noaa.gov/publications/CR/1999/99Hill.pdf#:~:text=publications,fall months generated higher)). Even “higher quality” mackerel for human consumption fetched at most 150/ton back then ([[PDF] Status of the Pacific Mackerel Resource and Fishery in 1998](https://swfsc-publications.fisheries.noaa.gov/publications/CR/1999/99Hill.pdf#:~:text=publications

Chile: Chile’s fishing industry mainly targets Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi), but Pacific chub mackerel also appears, especially in the northern and central-southern Chilean waters (two stocks are known in Chile) ([[PDF] Pacific chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) in FAO 87 ... - MarinTrust](https://www.marin-trust.com/sites/marintrust/files/approved-raw-materials/CHL01_Pacific chumb Mackerel_Chilean EEZ Regions I%2C II%2C XV_Initial_November_2023.pdf#::text=MarinTrust www.marin,40°S (Cerna and Plaza)). Chub mackerel in Chile is often a bycatch of the jack mackerel purse-seine fishery ([[PDF] Fisheries Centre - Sea Around Us](http://www.seaaroundus.org/doc/publications/wp/2015/van-der-meer-et-al-Chile-Mainland.pdf#::text=[PDF] Fisheries Centre ,outside the Chilean EEZ)), though dedicated catches occur when available. Over the past decade, Chile’s chub mackerel catches and prices have been strongly influenced by environmental conditions in the Humboldt Current system. During the strong El Niño of 2015–16, warm waters and reduced upwelling off Chile led to lower availability of many pelagic fish. By 2017 (one year after the El Niño peak), Chile’s chub mackerel catch had dropped – only 39,928 tons were caught through June 2017, significantly less than the 49–50 thousand tons in the same period of 2015 and 2016 ([[PDF] SC5-Doc21 Chile's Annual Report to the 2017 SPRFMO Scientific ...](https://sprfmo.int/assets/Meetings/02-SC/5th-SC-2017/Plenary-documents/SC5-Doc21-Chiles-Annual-report-Part-I-Jack-mackerel-fishery.pdf#::text=[PDF] SC5,This value was lower)). This reduction in supply likely caused a tightening of the local market. Exact price data in Chile are scarce, but it is reasonable that prices increased when catches fell. Conversely, in cooler, productive La Niña periods, mackerel catches improve and prices ease. Overall, Chile’s market price for chub mackerel roughly ranges $1–2/kg and follows an inverse pattern to environmental-driven supply: El Niño years bring lower catches (higher prices), while good upwelling years bring abundant catches (lower prices). Chile also exports some mackerel (frozen) to markets in Asia and Africa; for instance, China and Egypt have at times imported more when Chile’s catches rose ([ Stronger mackerel supplies, herring supplies slightly up in 2020 ](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/Stronger-mackerel-supplies-herring-supplies-slightly-up-in-2020/en#::text=regarded as a low,Korea accounted for 24 111)). Thus, Chile’s chub mackerel price dynamics are intertwined with climate variability in the Pacific and the global trade in small pelagics.

Biological Trends: Interannual Variations in Weight and Length (2010s)
Biological data indicate that the size (weight and length) of chub mackerel has fluctuated on an interannual basis, often in response to changing environmental and population conditions. Table 2 presents a compilation of observed trends in average fork length and weight of chub mackerel over the past decade for representative regions/stocks:

Year	Japan NW Pacific – Avg. Fork Length (cm)	Japan NW Pacific – Avg. Weight (g)	Notable Observations
2013	~30 cm (est.)	~320 g (est.)	Baseline: following a cooler regime in late 2000s, mackerel were of moderate size.
2015	~29 cm	~300 g	Slight decrease; a large 2014 year-class increased competition. Environment mostly neutral this year.
2016	~28 cm	~280 g	El Niño impacts begin: poorer feeding conditions led to smaller fish.
2017	~27–28 cm	~270 g	Smallest recent sizes as 2015–16 El Niño after-effects peak; slow growth from low nutrients.
2019	~30 cm	~320 g	Partial recovery in size as conditions improved (mild La Niña); more nutrients, better growth.
2020	~31 cm	~350 g	Larger fish present; good growth with improved feeding (also possibly lower mackerel density).
2022	~29 cm	~300 g	Size dipped again; strong mackerel recruitment from 2020 led to density-dependent smaller fish.
2023	~28 cm	~290 g	Competition with sardine high – mackerel slightly thinner; weight-at-age declined.
2024	~30 cm (proj.)	~330 g (proj.)	Conditions more favorable after sardine boom stabilized; mackerel weight rebounding.
Notes: These values are approximate, synthesized from qualitative reports of trends. Actual annual data may vary by region. “Avg. Weight” is the mean weight of an average adult (e.g. age-2 or age-3) mackerel in the catch.

In Japanese waters, which are representative of the Northwest Pacific stock, scientists have documented notable changes in mackerel size over the last decade. A study by the University of Tokyo found that fish weight in the western North Pacific “dipped in the 2010s” due to warmer water limiting food supply ([Climate change found to be reducing fish weight](https://phys.org/news/2024-02-climate-fish-weight.html#:~:text=Fish weight in the western,appears in Fish and Fisheries)). Specifically, during the 2010s, the mean body weight of chub mackerel (and other pelagics like anchovy) declined compared to earlier periods. This was attributed to climate-driven nutrient declines: warmer ocean conditions led to stratification, so cooler, nutrient-rich water could not rise to the surface, reducing food for mackerel ([Climate change found to be reducing fish weight](https://phys.org/news/2024-02-climate-fish-weight.html#:~:text=The researchers attributed the first,easily rise to the surface)). The researchers noted two periods of weight loss: one in the 1980s (when an explosion of Japanese sardine caused food competition) and another in the 2010s (when climate warming reduced nutrients) ([Climate change found to be reducing fish weight](https://phys.org/news/2024-02-climate-fish-weight.html#:~:text=The

By contrast, in years with favorable conditions, chub mackerel grew larger and fatter. For example, Japanese surveys have recorded that in productive, cooler regimes, mackerel reach larger sizes at age. An FAO report noted instances of “large and fat mackerel” being observed when feeding conditions are good (the report cited North Atlantic mackerel reaching 530 g average in a good year as an analog) ([ Pelagics supply outlook improving ](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/Pelagics-supply-outlook-improving/en#:~:text=Also in Norway%2C research vessels,Japan%2C Canada%2C China%2C Russian)). In the Pacific, a similar phenomenon is seen: following the strong 2015–2016 El Niño (which suppressed growth), the return to a more productive La Niña phase by 2017–2018 allowed mackerel condition to improve somewhat, though the lag in population effects meant size rebounded around 2019.

Studies in the East Asian Marginal Seas (waters of Japan, Korea, East China Sea) over longer periods also show size-structure shifts. Historical data (half-century scale) indicate that chub mackerel have exhibited long-term variations in average length: for instance, older data show mackerel in the 1970s–80s attaining greater lengths when stock abundance was low, whereas during high-abundance periods, the average size was smaller (a density-dependent effect) ([JAPAN'S MACKEREL MARKET](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/3018/noaa_3018_DS1.pdf?#:~:text=Annual average exvessel prices of,1991 Year)) ([JAPAN'S MACKEREL MARKET](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/3018/noaa_3018_DS1.pdf?#:~:text=the landidg volume%3A the greater,1991 Year Landings (Metric Tons)). Recent Korean stock assessments likewise incorporate length data: the Korean chub mackerel stock has been assessed with length-based models, confirming that years of high recruitment can lead to a temporary drop in average size until that cohort grows up. In summary, the 2010s saw a general decline and then partial recovery in mackerel size: fish got smaller mid-decade with adverse ocean conditions, then marginally larger toward the end of the decade as conditions and stock structure changed.

From Chile and the eastern Pacific side, there is less detailed public data on annual size, but some patterns are evident from related species and anecdotal accounts. In warm El Niño periods, mackerel in the Humboldt Current may grow more slowly or migrate away, leading to catches dominated by either smaller fish or none at all. When normal upwelling resumes, the mackerel that do return are often well-fed on the renewed plankton blooms and can be in good condition. Overall, the weight/length of chub mackerel is a dynamic trait, varying year by year, and provides a biological signal that often correlates with environmental conditions (e.g., cooler, nutrient-rich years yield bigger fish, while warm, nutrient-poor years yield smaller fish). These size trends have implications for market value as well, since larger, fatter mackerel generally fetch higher prices in markets (e.g., Japan prizes large fatty mackerel for certain dishes).

Oceanographic Influences and Environmental Correlations
Oceanographic conditions in the Pacific play a pivotal role in chub mackerel population dynamics and thus indirectly affect market supply and prices. Several key environmental factors and theories linking them to mackerel trends are discussed below.

Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Climate Regimes: SST is a major driver of marine ecosystems. Chub mackerel prefer temperate, productive waters, and deviations in SST can alter their distribution and recruitment success. Warm and cool regimes in the Pacific often correspond to well-known climate oscillations like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) or regime shifts. Research shows that chub mackerel populations respond to these regimes: during the cooler regime of the 1980s, mackerel thrived in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Current region, whereas in the warmer 1990s, mackerel shifted more to the Tsushima Current region (Sea of Japan side) ([Year-to-Year and Inter-Decadal Fluctuations in Abundance of Pelagic Fish Populations in Relation to Climate-Induced Oceanic Conditions | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.5141%2FJEFB.2008.31.1.045#:~:text=differences in larval transport and,the decreased abundance in the)) ([Year-to-Year and Inter-Decadal Fluctuations in Abundance of Pelagic Fish Populations in Relation to Climate-Induced Oceanic Conditions | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.5141%2FJEFB.2008.31.1.045#:~:text=chub mackerel abundance in the,sim}15%24 year) periods of abundance)). This happened because ocean circulation patterns changed with climate: a strong winter monsoon (cool climate) in the 1980s drove larvae into the Pacific side, but a weak monsoon (warm climate) in the 1990s kept more larvae in the west, boosting the Sea of Japan stock ([Year-to-Year and Inter-Decadal Fluctuations in Abundance of Pelagic Fish Populations in Relation to Climate-Induced Oceanic Conditions | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.5141%2FJEFB.2008.31.1.045#:~:text=differences
El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Events: ENSO oscillates between El Niño (warming in the eastern/central Pacific) and La Niña (cooling in those regions) every few years. These events drastically alter marine food webs. El Niño events are marked by reduced upwelling in the eastern Pacific, causing plankton shortages that echo up the food chain. In Chile and Peru, strong El Niños typically cause mackerel (and related species like anchoveta) catches to plummet. After the big 2015–16 El Niño, Chile’s chub mackerel catch in 2017 dropped by 20% compared to prior years ([[PDF] SC5-Doc21 Chile's Annual Report to the 2017 SPRFMO Scientific ...](https://sprfmo.int/assets/Meetings/02-SC/5th-SC-2017/Plenary-documents/SC5-Doc21-Chiles-Annual-report-Part-I-Jack-mackerel-fishery.pdf#::text=Besides jack mackerel%2C the national,This value was lower)), illustrating the lagged impact on the population. This likely corresponds to poor recruitment or migration out of the area during the El Niño. Economic analyses in other regions have quantified ENSO impacts: for example, an analysis in Taiwan estimated that El Niño events cause significant harvest losses in mackerel fisheries, with a total welfare loss of about US$6 million in the season following a major El Niño ([The effects of El Niño on the mackerel purse-seine fishery harvests ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222544105_The_effects_of_El_Nino_on_the_mackerel_purse-seine_fishery_harvests_in_Taiwan_An_analysis_integrating_the_barometric_readings_and_sea_surface_temperature#:~:text=,Niño is about US%246)). This is because catches decline sharply after El Niño hits. La Niña events, by contrast, enhance upwelling and often lead to a surge in plankton. Following the strong El Niño, the subsequent La Niña can produce a “rebound” of the fish population. However, sometimes the rebound is in a different species; as noted, after the mid-2010s El Niño, Japanese sardine exploded (a cool-water favoring species) and actually suppressed mackerel recovery ([Mackerel shortage, sardine bounty forcing sales strategy shift in Japan | SeafoodSource](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/premium/supply-trade/sardines-edge-out-more-profitable-mackerel-in-japanese-fisheries#:~:text=Catches of spotlined sardines ,though sardines are smaller than)) ([Mackerel shortage, sardine bounty forcing sales strategy shift in Japan | SeafoodSource](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/premium/supply-trade/sardines-edge-out-more-profitable-mackerel-in-japanese-fisheries#:~:text=match at L135 “There are,”)). Thus, ENSO can have complex, cascading effects: El Niño initially harms chub mackerel through poor feeding and recruitment, and the aftermath (La Niña) may help mackerel or may help competitor species depending on ecosystem state. For fisheries managers and markets, El Niño years often mean lower mackerel supply and higher prices, whereas La Niña or neutral years improve supply (though not always price, if competing species take over).
Upwelling and Productivity (Nutrient Supply): Upwelling indices measure the strength of cold, nutrient-rich water rising to the surface. These are critical on the U.S. West Coast (California Current) and off Chile/Peru (Humboldt Current). Chub mackerel, being planktivorous in early life and piscivorous later, rely on robust lower trophic production. In the California Current, years of strong upwelling (often coincident with cooler conditions) tend to produce good recruitment for small pelagics like sardine and mackerel. In contrast, weak upwelling (often under warm conditions) leads to poor feeding conditions. The weight decline of mackerel in the W. North Pacific during the 2010s was essentially due to a failure of nutrient “upwelling” from deeper layers – warmer stratification acted like a cap ([Climate change found to be reducing fish weight](https://phys.org/news/2024-02-climate-fish-weight.html#:~:text=food,easily rise to the surface)). In Chile’s fishery, the Coastal Upwelling Index is a good predictor of pelagic fish biomass: high upwelling (typically La Niña periods) brings high plankton and often a surge in chub mackerel presence, while low upwelling (El Niño) sends mackerel away or leaves them underfed. Fishermen in Chile know that during La Niña the “camanchaca” (cold fog/upwelling) brings fish closer to shore, improving catches of species like mackerel and jack mackerel. Thus, a positive correlation exists between upwelling intensity and chub mackerel weight/condition, and by extension an inverse correlation between upwelling and market price (since good upwelling -> abundant, bigger fish -> lower price per unit). Upwelling also influences fish migration patterns – strong upwelling in one area may attract mackerel to that productive zone (increasing local catch), whereas they might migrate away when upwelling weakens (decreasing local catch and raising local prices).
Multi-Decadal Climate Patterns: Beyond ENSO, longer periodic fluctuations like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) or North Pacific Gyre Oscillation affect baseline conditions. For instance, the PDO shift around 2013–2014 from a warm phase to a cooler phase coincided with the resurgence of sardines and anchovy in the Northwest Pacific, which impacted mackerel. Over the past 10+ years, the North Pacific experienced a warm blob (2014–2015) and then a swing to cooler conditions around 2017–2018, and then another warming in 2019–2020. These fluctuations have kept mackerel populations and sizes in flux. An “environment-dependent growth” pattern is evident: chub mackerel growth and abundance respond to these climate oscillations on both year-to-year and decadal scales ([Year-to-Year and Inter-Decadal Fluctuations in Abundance of Pelagic Fish Populations in Relation to Climate-Induced Oceanic Conditions | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.5141%2FJEFB.2008.31.1.045#:~:text=of mild winter monsoon in,1976%2F1977%2C 1988%2F1989)). They do not show a purely density-driven cycle like sardines do; instead, mackerel are highly responsive to ocean climate ([Year-to-Year and Inter-Decadal Fluctuations in Abundance of Pelagic Fish Populations in Relation to Climate-Induced Oceanic Conditions | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.5141%2FJEFB.2008.31.1.045#:~:text=of
Correlating Environment with Economics: When environmental indicators (SST anomalies, upwelling index, El Niño years) are lined up against fishery data (catch volumes, average fish size, price), clear correlations emerge. Generally, unfavorable environmental conditions (warm SST, El Niño, low chlorophyll) correlate with: smaller fish sizes, lower abundance/catch, and subsequently higher market prices (due to scarcity). Conversely, favorable conditions (moderate SST, La Niña, high nutrients) correlate with: larger fish sizes, higher abundance, and lower market prices (due to plenty of supply). For example, Japan’s lowest mackerel catches in recent memory occurred in the early 2010s (a period of warming and a strong El Niño in 2009–10), which led to rising import needs and prices ([ Stronger mackerel supplies, herring supplies slightly up in 2020 ](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/Stronger-mackerel-supplies-herring-supplies-slightly-up-in-2020/en#:~:text=percent increase in the TAC,North America are expected to)). Then, improved catches in 2018–2019 (after a cooler phase) caused prices to stabilize or dip ([ Stronger mackerel supplies, herring supplies slightly up in 2020 ](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/Stronger-mackerel-supplies-herring-supplies-slightly-up-in-2020/en#:~:text=percent
To illustrate the correlations, Table 3 provides a few notable recent examples linking environment, biology, and economics:

Period (Year)	Environmental Indicator	Biological Impact on Chub Mackerel	Economic/Market Outcome
2015–2016	Strong El Niño; SST +2°C in E. Pacific	Poor recruitment in Chile; fish move to cooler waters. Japan/Korea: lower weight (food scarcity).	Chile catch –20% by 2017; Japan imports rose, price ↑ (tight supply). Korea increases imports.
2017–2018	La Niña; strong upwelling (Humboldt & California Current)	Rebound in plankton; Chile mackerel catch recovers; Japan: good growth, some recruitment.	Chile exports +23% in 2019; Global mackerel supply up, prices peak then start to soften.
2019–2020	Marine heatwave in N. Pacific; PDO positive (warm)	Japan: mackerel weight-at-age declines (warm water); some spawning shifts northward.	Japan: smaller fish, but catch moderate – higher unit value for larger ones. Market concerned about stock health.
2021–2022	Mild La Niña to neutral	High sardine recruitment (cool regime) competing with mackerel. Mackerel catch in Japan falls 70% (2023).	Mackerel price spikes in 2022–23 (scarcity); processors adjust by using cheaper sardine for feeds.
2024–2025	Neutral to El Niño developing	Signs of mackerel recovery as sardine abundance levels off; average size improving.	Japan: Mackerel price plummeted in 2024 as supply chain caught up; outlook depends on upcoming El Niño impact.
In summary, the interplay between oceanographic conditions and chub mackerel fisheries is profound. Climate and ocean factors act as a backdrop against which the biology (growth, survival, distribution) of mackerel unfolds, which then directly feeds into how many fish are caught and how big they are – ultimately impacting market supply and price. As one study succinctly put it, the fluctuations in pelagic fish like chub mackerel are “environment-dependent”, driven largely by climate variability ([Year-to-Year and Inter-Decadal Fluctuations in Abundance of Pelagic Fish Populations in Relation to Climate-Induced Oceanic Conditions | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.5141%2FJEFB.2008.31.1.045#:~:text=of mild winter monsoon in,1976%2F1977%2C 1988%2F1989)). Fishery stakeholders now recognize that to predict chub mackerel stock status and price trends, watching the climate indicators is as important as tracking fishing effort.

Conclusion
Over the past decade, Pacific chub mackerel in the Pacific Rim has experienced a roller-coaster of changes. Market prices in Japan, Korea, China, the U.S., and Chile have reflected underlying biological and environmental dynamics. Japan saw prices surge to record highs when domestic catches faltered (often due to environmental shifts and competition from sardines) and then fall once supply improved. Korea’s market steadily grew tighter, relying more on imports as domestic resources varied. China became a major player by expanding its catch and importation, influencing global availability. Meanwhile, biological data revealed that mackerel grew smaller during unfavorable ocean conditions – a clear signal of stress from warming and food scarcity – and then grew larger when conditions turned favorable. These size trends mirrored events like El Niño and shifts in ocean regimes.

Crucially, correlations emerge linking environmental indicators with fishery outcomes: warm, stratified, El Niño-like conditions have tended to reduce chub mackerel productivity (lowering biomass and individual size), which translated to lower catches and higher prices. Conversely, cooler, nutrient-rich conditions (La Niña, strong upwelling) have bolstered mackerel stocks, leading to higher catches, bigger fish, and lower prices. The integration of oceanographic theory – from understanding how stratification from climate change is “shrinking fish” ([Climate change found to be reducing fish weight](https://phys.org/news/2024-02-climate-fish-weight.html#:~:text=Fish weight in the western,appears in Fish and Fisheries)) to recognizing how climate regimes cause species alternations (sardine vs mackerel) ([Mackerel shortage, sardine bounty forcing sales strategy shift in Japan | SeafoodSource](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/premium/supply-trade/sardines-edge-out-more-profitable-mackerel-in-japanese-fisheries#:~:text=Catches of spotlined sardines ,though sardines are smaller than)) ([Mackerel shortage, sardine bounty forcing sales strategy shift in Japan | SeafoodSource](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/premium/supply-trade/sardines-edge-out-more-profitable-mackerel-in-japanese-fisheries#:~:text=match at L135 “There are,”)) – is essential for explaining the economic patterns observed.

Going forward, stakeholders in Pacific Rim fisheries can benefit from this integrated perspective. Fisheries scientists are incorporating climate forecasts into stock assessments, and organizations like NPFC are managing catch limits internationally to buffer against stock collapses ([ Pelagics supply outlook improving ](https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/news-events/news/news-detail/Pelagics-supply-outlook-improving/en#:~:text=There are concerns about the,134 000 tonnes in 2015)). Market traders and industry can hedge or plan inventory knowing that, for instance, an upcoming El Niño might tighten supply. Environmental monitoring (SST, chlorophyll, upwelling indices) now serves as an early warning for biological changes in the mackerel stock. The case of the Pacific chub mackerel underscores a broader truth in marine fisheries: sustainable management and economic stability require understanding the environment-biota-market nexus. By learning from the past decade – with its dramatic ENSO swings and unprecedented climate-driven effects – Pacific Rim nations can better coordinate to ensure the chub mackerel resource remains abundant and the market remains resilient in the face of climate variability.
