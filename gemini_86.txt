Manufacturing Technology Analysis for Hollow Motor Shafts in New Energy Vehicle Electric Drive Units
Executive Summary

New Energy Vehicle (NEV) electric drive units (EDUs) rely critically on the performance and reliability of their constituent components, among which the hollow motor shaft plays a pivotal role in transmitting power from the electric motor to the drivetrain. The trend towards higher motor speeds and integrated EDU designs (e-axles) imposes stringent requirements on these shafts, demanding high strength, exceptional fatigue resistance, precise dimensional control, and lightweight characteristics, all within the economic constraints of mass production. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of established and emerging manufacturing technologies suitable for producing hollow motor shafts for NEV applications. It evaluates deep hole drilling, extrusion, rotary swaging, flow forming, welding/joining techniques (primarily friction welding), additive manufacturing, and hydroforming. The comparison considers material suitability, achievable quality (tolerances, surface finish), resultant mechanical properties (especially fatigue life), process chain complexity (subsequent processing needs), cost-effectiveness, and suitability for high-volume production. The analysis indicates that near-net shape cold forming processes, specifically Rotary Swaging and Flow Forming, offer the most advantageous combination of precision, material property enhancement (through work hardening), high material utilization, and suitability for mass production. Rotary Friction Welding emerges as a key enabling technology, allowing for hybrid shaft designs that optimize material usage and cost by joining dissimilar materials or pre-formed sections. While emerging technologies like Additive Manufacturing offer design flexibility, they currently face significant challenges regarding fatigue performance consistency and cost-effectiveness for this application. Hydroforming shows potential for complex geometries but may be less competitive for typical shaft designs compared to swaging or flow forming. Recommendations focus on adopting Rotary Swaging or Flow Forming as primary manufacturing routes, potentially integrated with Rotary Friction Welding for optimized designs, to meet the demanding requirements of NEV hollow motor shafts in high-volume production.

1. Introduction

1.1. Context: Role and Importance of Hollow Motor Shafts in NEV EDUs

The transition towards electric mobility necessitates continuous innovation in the design and manufacturing of components within New Energy Vehicle (NEV) powertrains. The Electric Drive Unit (EDU), often integrating the electric motor, power electronics, and transmission into a compact e-axle assembly 1, is central to vehicle performance. Within the EDU, the motor shaft serves the critical function of transmitting the rotational torque generated by the electric motor's rotor to the subsequent stages of the drivetrain, typically a gearbox or differential.

A significant trend in NEV motor design involves utilizing hollow shafts rather than solid ones. The primary driver for this is weight reduction. Minimizing component mass is paramount in electric vehicles, as it directly contributes to improved energy efficiency, extended driving range, and enhanced vehicle dynamics. Beyond weight savings, the hollow geometry offers potential design advantages, such as space for passing cooling fluids, electrical wiring, or even accommodating smaller concentric shafts within the main shaft structure.9

Furthermore, NEV development is characterized by a push towards higher electric motor operating speeds, with maximum speeds reaching or exceeding 20,000 rpm in contemporary series applications.1 Operating at higher speeds allows for a reduction in motor size and mass for a given power output, thereby improving the EDU's power density and potentially lowering costs.1 However, these elevated speeds place significantly greater demands on the motor shaft. It must possess exceptional strength to handle the transmitted torque, superior fatigue resistance to withstand billions of loading cycles over the vehicle's lifetime, excellent dynamic balance to prevent vibrations, and high stiffness to maintain critical speeds well above the operating range.10 The manufacturing process chosen for the hollow shaft is therefore critical, as it directly influences the achievable geometric precision, surface quality, material microstructure, residual stress state, and ultimately, the shaft's performance, durability, and cost.

2. Requirements Specification for NEV Hollow Motor Shafts

Defining the target specifications is crucial for evaluating the suitability of different manufacturing processes. NEV hollow motor shafts operate under demanding conditions and require a combination of specific material properties, tight dimensional control, and high durability, all achievable within a mass production framework.

2.1. Material Grades and Properties

The selection of material is fundamental to meeting the performance demands of NEV motor shafts. High-strength steels are the predominant choice due to their favorable balance of mechanical properties, durability, fatigue resistance, and cost-effectiveness.

Common Materials: Medium carbon steels, such as 1045 grade, are sometimes used, often requiring appropriate heat treatment.12 However, the demanding nature of NEV applications frequently necessitates the use of higher-performance alloy steels. Common examples include chromium-molybdenum steels like 4140 and 4340, known for their high strength and toughness after heat treatment.13 Case-hardening steels, such as 20CrMnTi, are also employed, particularly where surface hardness combined with core toughness is critical.14 Materials suitable for induction hardening are also specified for achieving localized surface hardness.15 While low carbon steels might be considered for cost or formability, they typically require significant hardening processes (e.g., carburizing) to meet performance requirements.9 Stainless steels offer inherent corrosion resistance but generally exhibit lower thermal conductivity compared to carbon or alloy steels, which might be a consideration for heat dissipation.13
Mechanical Strength: The shaft must possess high tensile and yield strength to withstand the significant torque loads experienced during vehicle acceleration and regenerative braking without undergoing plastic deformation. Typical tensile strength requirements range from approximately 570-700 MPa for medium carbon steels like 1045, up to 1300 MPa or more for quenched and tempered alloy steels such as 4140 or 4340.13 Correspondingly, yield strengths range from around 250-450 MPa for medium carbon steels to over 600 MPa for treated alloy steels.13
Fatigue Strength (Endurance Limit): This is arguably the most critical mechanical property for NEV motor shafts due to the high number of rotational cycles and fluctuating torque loads experienced during operation. Failure is most commonly attributed to fatigue crack initiation and propagation, often starting at stress concentrations like keyways, fillets, or surface imperfections.11 The design philosophy typically targets an "infinite" fatigue life, generally defined as surviving more than 10^6 to 10^7 loading cycles without failure under expected operating stresses.17 For high-strength alloy steels, the fatigue endurance limit can often exceed 50% of the ultimate tensile strength.13 The manufacturing process itself plays a crucial role, as factors like surface finish quality, the presence of defects (inclusions, porosity), residual stresses induced during forming or welding, and grain flow significantly influence fatigue performance.18 Consequently, the combination of high torque, high rotational speeds, and the imperative for long operational life under cyclic loading makes fatigue strength a paramount driver in selecting materials and subsequent processing steps (like heat treatment and surface finishing) for NEV hollow motor shafts. This often leads to the selection of specific alloy steels or case-hardening grades, which offer superior fatigue resistance compared to simpler carbon steels when appropriately processed.11
Hardness: Adequate surface hardness is necessary to resist wear, particularly at interfaces with bearings, seals, and splines or gear teeth. Target hardness values often fall within the range of HRc 35-45, depending on the specific location and material.13 This hardness is typically achieved through heat treatment processes such as case carburizing, nitriding, induction hardening, or quenching and tempering tailored to the chosen steel grade.9
Thermal Properties: Compatibility in thermal expansion between the shaft, rotor, bearings, and housing is important to prevent thermally induced stresses or loss of interference fit during operation across varying temperatures.13 Materials with low coefficients of thermal expansion might be preferred in high-precision applications or where significant temperature fluctuations occur.13 Thermal conductivity also plays a role in heat dissipation from the motor rotor through the shaft.
2.2. Dimensional and Geometric Tolerances

Precise dimensional and geometric control is essential for the proper function and longevity of NEV motor shafts operating at high speeds. Tight tolerances ensure correct assembly with mating components (rotor, bearings, seals, transmission elements), minimize vibration and noise, and maintain alignment under load.36

Diameter Tolerances: Specific diameter tolerances are critical, particularly at bearing journals, seal surfaces, and interfaces with the rotor or transmission components (e.g., splines). The required tolerance depends on the type of fit needed – clearance fits for rotating elements like bearings, interference fits for components like the rotor hub, or transition fits.37 Standardized tolerance grades, such as those defined by ISO (e.g., H7 hole basis, with corresponding shaft tolerances like g6, h6, k6, p6, etc.) or equivalent NEMA/IEC standards for motor shafts, are often specified.37 Manufacturing processes like rotary swaging can achieve tolerances in the range of IT8-IT9 26, while flow forming is noted for high dimensional accuracy 41, and deep hole drilling can also achieve close tolerances with appropriate equipment.43
Wall Thickness: For hollow shafts, controlling wall thickness is crucial for balancing strength requirements with weight optimization goals. Uniformity of wall thickness is also important for dynamic balance. Flow forming offers particularly precise control over wall thickness variation.42
Straightness & Concentricity: Maintaining high degrees of straightness along the shaft axis and concentricity between different diameter sections (especially bearing journals relative to each other and the main shaft body) is vital for minimizing runout and ensuring smooth rotation at high speeds, thereby reducing vibration and bearing loads. Deep hole drilling processes are specifically designed to optimize straightness 45, and flow forming also yields high geometric accuracy.41
Runout: Total Indicator Runout (TIR) is tightly controlled, particularly at bearing seats, seal surfaces, and mounting flanges, to ensure dynamic stability. NEMA and IEC standards provide permissible runout values for different shaft sizes and types.38
Surface Finish: Smooth surface finishes (low Ra values) are required on surfaces mating with bearings and seals to minimize friction, prevent leakage, and reduce wear, thus extending component life.21 While some forming processes like flow forming (potentially Ra 0.6 µm ID) 41 and rotary swaging 26 can produce relatively smooth surfaces, subsequent finishing operations such as grinding, honing, or roller burnishing are often necessary to achieve the very fine finishes (e.g., Ra < 0.4 µm) required for these critical interfaces.43 The quality of the surface finish also has a profound impact on fatigue life, as surface irregularities act as stress raisers where fatigue cracks can initiate.21
The simultaneous achievement of tight tolerances across multiple geometric features (diameter, straightness, concentricity, runout) and surface finish specifications represents a significant manufacturing challenge. Processes capable of producing near-net shapes, such as flow forming or rotary swaging, can potentially reduce the amount of subsequent finishing required compared to methods starting further from the final geometry, like drilling from solid.26 However, achieving the extremely high precision and surface quality demanded by critical areas like bearing seats often necessitates dedicated finishing operations regardless of the primary forming method.48 The capability of the initial forming process thus directly influences the complexity and cost of the entire manufacturing sequence needed to meet the final specifications, especially considering the critical link between surface quality and fatigue performance.21

2.3. Operating Conditions and Performance Demands

NEV motor shafts operate in a demanding environment characterized by high speeds, high torques, and the need for exceptional durability.

High Rotational Speed: As mentioned, speeds up to and potentially exceeding 20,000 rpm are common.1 This necessitates excellent dynamic balance to minimize vibrations and requires the shaft's natural bending frequencies (critical speeds) to be well above the maximum operating speed to avoid resonance phenomena.10
High Torque Transmission: Shafts must reliably transmit the full torque generated by the electric motor during acceleration, as well as handle the reverse torques during regenerative braking. Peak torque requirements can be substantial, influenced by motor power and gear ratios.1 EDU systems can generate axle torques in the range of 4,000-5,300 Nm, indicating significant torque handling capacity is needed at the motor shaft level.4
Durability & Reliability: NEV components are expected to last the lifetime of the vehicle, potentially exceeding hundreds of thousands of miles.51 This translates to billions of stress cycles for the motor shaft, demanding exceptional fatigue resistance under variable amplitude loading conditions.17 Designs often aim for infinite fatigue life under normal operating conditions.
Operating Temperature: Shafts must function reliably across a wide range of ambient temperatures and also withstand heat generated internally by the motor windings and rotor losses. Material properties, including strength, stiffness, and thermal expansion, must remain stable and predictable within the expected operating temperature envelope.13
Integration: The shaft design must facilitate seamless integration with adjacent components. This includes precise fits for bearings (often press-fit or slip-fit depending on design), effective sealing arrangements, a secure connection to the motor rotor (commonly an interference fit), and a robust interface with the transmission, typically via splines or integral gears.15
2.4. Mass Production Considerations

Beyond technical performance, the manufacturing process must be suitable for the scale and economic realities of the automotive industry.

High Volume: NEV production volumes are rapidly increasing, necessitating manufacturing processes capable of producing shafts in quantities ranging from hundreds of thousands to potentially millions per year per vehicle platform. Processes must be scalable and repeatable.
Cost-Effectiveness: Unit production cost is a critical factor in the competitive automotive market. Preferred manufacturing routes are those that offer high material utilization efficiency (minimizing scrap), short cycle times, low labor input (through automation), reasonable tooling costs amortized over large volumes, and manageable energy consumption.41
Consistency & Quality Control: The chosen process must consistently produce parts that meet all stringent specifications with minimal variation lot-to-lot and part-to-part. Robust quality control measures must be integrated throughout the manufacturing chain.

3. Analysis of Established Manufacturing Technologies

Several established manufacturing processes are employed or could be adapted for producing hollow shafts. Each presents a unique set of capabilities, limitations, and economic considerations.

3.1. Deep Hole Drilling (from solid bar)

Process Description: This subtractive method starts with a solid bar of the chosen material and creates the central hole using specialized deep hole drilling techniques. The two primary methods are Gun Drilling and BTA (Boring and Trepanning Association) drilling.45 Gun drilling employs a single-flute tool with internal coolant passages and external guide pads, typically suitable for smaller diameters (approx. 1 mm to 50 mm) and very high depth-to-diameter ratios (L/D > 10:1, potentially up to 400:1).45 BTA drilling uses a specialized drill head with multiple cutting edges and internal chip evacuation through the drill tube, generally applied to larger diameters (approx. 20 mm to over 700 mm) and offering significantly higher penetration rates (often cited as 4x faster) than gun drilling, making it more economical for larger bores and long production runs.45 Both methods rely heavily on high-pressure coolant systems (delivered through the tool) to effectively flush chips from the deep hole, cool the cutting zone, and lubricate the guide pads.45 To optimize hole straightness, the process can be configured with a rotating tool and stationary workpiece, a rotating workpiece and stationary tool, or counter-rotation of both.43 Specialized deep hole drilling machines are designed for rigidity and precise alignment to manage the challenges of maintaining straightness over long drilling depths.45
Suitable Materials: Deep hole drilling is versatile and applicable to a wide spectrum of materials used in shaft production, including various grades of carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless steel, aluminum alloys, and even more challenging materials like titanium and superalloys.45 The selection of drill material (High-Speed Steel - HSS, or solid carbide/carbide inserts) and appropriate coatings (e.g., TiN, TiCN, TiAlN, AlTiN) is critical and depends on the workpiece material and desired performance.47
Cost Factors: A major drawback of this method is extremely poor material utilization. The entire core of the shaft is removed as low-value chips, representing significant material waste and cost, especially with expensive alloys. Tooling costs include the specialized gun drills or BTA heads, which can be expensive, and their wear/replacement contributes to operating costs. Cycle times can be lengthy, particularly for very deep or small-diameter holes using gun drilling, although BTA offers faster rates.48 The process requires dedicated, specialized deep hole drilling machines, representing a significant capital investment.45
Subsequent Processing: Deep hole drilling typically necessitates considerable subsequent processing to achieve the final shaft specifications. While the process can achieve good initial straightness and diameter control 43, the as-drilled internal surface finish (though generally better than conventional drilling 43) may not meet the requirements for bearing or seal interfaces. Therefore, secondary operations like honing, roller burnishing, or internal grinding are frequently required to achieve the final ID tolerances and surface finish specifications.48 Furthermore, the external geometry (steps, tapers, bearing journals, splines) must be created through conventional machining operations like turning and grinding. Heat treatment (e.g., quenching and tempering, induction hardening) is typically performed either on the solid bar before drilling or on the machined shaft afterwards.
Achievable Quality: With appropriate equipment and process control, deep hole drilling can produce holes with excellent straightness and close dimensional tolerances on the diameter.43 The surface finish is generally superior to conventional drilling but often requires refinement through secondary processes for critical applications.43 Concentricity of the hole to the OD depends on the setup (rotating workpiece generally better) and subsequent OD machining accuracy.45
Mechanical Properties: The bulk mechanical properties of the shaft are primarily determined by the starting bar material and the subsequent heat treatment processes. The drilling operation itself does not inherently enhance strength or fatigue properties through mechanisms like work hardening, unlike forming processes. However, the drilling process can introduce residual stresses near the internal surface.
Pros & Cons for NEV Shafts:
Pros: Applicable to a vast range of materials; capable of achieving high levels of straightness and diameter accuracy for the bore; it is an established technology with well-understood principles.
Cons: Extremely inefficient material utilization leads to high material costs and waste; potentially long cycle times, especially for smaller diameters; requires extensive subsequent machining for both OD features and ID finishing; overall process chain complexity and cost are high for mass production due to material waste and multiple steps.
The fundamental inefficiency stemming from the removal of the entire core material makes deep hole drilling from a solid bar an economically and environmentally unfavorable approach for the mass production of hollow shafts.62 While technically capable of producing the required hole geometry and precision, the inherent material wastage translates directly into higher costs associated with raw material procurement and chip management/recycling. This positions it at a significant disadvantage compared to forming methods that start with a hollow preform or shape the material closer to the final net geometry, particularly in the cost-sensitive, high-volume context of NEV manufacturing.
3.2. Extrusion (Hot & Cold)

Process Description: Extrusion involves forcing a metal billet through a die orifice under high pressure to create a product with a constant cross-section, typically a seamless tube in the context of hollow shaft precursors. The process can be performed hot (above the material's recrystallization temperature) or cold (at or near room temperature).63 Hot extrusion allows for greater deformation and more complex shapes due to lower material resistance but results in lower dimensional accuracy and poorer surface finish due to thermal contraction and oxidation/scaling. Cold extrusion provides better dimensional control, superior surface finish, and enhances material strength through strain hardening, but is limited by the material's ductility and requires higher forces.63 Extrusion is commonly used to produce the seamless tube stock that serves as the starting material (preform) for other shaft manufacturing processes.
Suitable Materials: Extrusion is applicable to a variety of metals, including carbon and alloy steels, aluminum alloys, and copper alloys. The choice between hot and cold extrusion depends heavily on the material's properties (ductility, strength, recrystallization temperature) and the desired preform characteristics.
Comparison (Hot vs. Cold for Steel Hollow Shaft Preforms - based on 63**):**
Tolerances: Cold extrusion offers superior geometric accuracy and tighter tolerances compared to hot extrusion.
Surface Finish: Cold extrusion yields a significantly better surface finish as it avoids the oxidation and scale formation inherent in hot working.
Material Properties: Hot extrusion can refine the grain structure and improve toughness, especially if starting from a cast billet, although this benefit may be less pronounced if starting with already wrought material. Cold extrusion significantly increases strength and hardness via strain hardening (work hardening).
Cost: Cold extrusion avoids the energy costs associated with heating the billet and furnace maintenance, and potentially offers higher production rates. Hot extrusion requires substantial energy for heating but necessitates lower forming forces, potentially allowing for less robust equipment or larger deformation ratios.
Near-Net Shape: While extrusion produces a near-net shape tube, hot extrusion generally allows for more complex cross-sectional geometries if needed. Cold extrusion provides higher accuracy for simpler tubular shapes.
Subsequent Processing: Extruded tubes, whether hot or cold formed, almost always require significant subsequent processing to become a finished motor shaft. This includes cutting the tube to the required length, extensive machining operations (turning, grinding) to create the necessary external features (steps, tapers, bearing journals, splines), potentially internal machining or finishing (honing, boring) depending on the required ID tolerance and finish, and heat treatment to achieve the final specified mechanical properties.
Achievable Quality: Cold extrusion provides better dimensional tolerances and surface finish for the tube preform compared to hot extrusion. However, the final quality of the shaft is largely dictated by the precision of the subsequent machining and finishing operations.
Mechanical Properties: Hot extruded tubes possess properties typical of hot-worked materials, generally characterized by a refined, equiaxed grain structure and lower strength/hardness compared to cold-worked or heat-treated states. Cold extruded tubes exhibit significantly increased strength and hardness due to strain hardening, but also reduced ductility. A subsequent heat treatment (annealing, normalizing, or quenching and tempering) is usually essential after extrusion (especially cold extrusion) to tailor the mechanical properties (strength, toughness, fatigue resistance) to the final application requirements.
Pros & Cons for NEV Shafts:
Pros: Highly efficient method for producing long lengths of high-quality seamless tubing, which serves as an excellent starting point for hollow shafts. Cold extrusion can provide a strong, accurate preform. Hot extrusion allows for potentially larger diameter reductions or specific profile requirements.
Cons: Extrusion primarily produces the intermediate tubular preform, not the final complex shaft geometry. It necessitates substantial and costly subsequent machining operations to create the final part features. Hot extrusion suffers from lower accuracy and finish. Cold extrusion is limited by material ductility and the amount of deformation achievable.
Extrusion should be viewed primarily as an efficient method for creating the initial seamless tube, rather than a process for manufacturing the final complex NEV motor shaft directly.41 Its main value proposition lies in generating a high-quality hollow preform that can then be further processed by more specialized forming techniques like flow forming or rotary swaging, or through extensive machining. The decision between hot and cold extrusion for this initial tube depends on a trade-off between the desired preform accuracy and strength (favoring cold) versus the allowable deformation and material characteristics (potentially favoring hot for less ductile alloys or larger reductions).
3.3. Rotary Swaging

Process Description: Rotary swaging is an incremental forging process specifically suited for reducing the cross-section of cylindrical workpieces, including tubes and bars.65 It utilizes multiple dies (typically two or four, sometimes more) arranged radially around the workpiece.64 These dies are housed in a rotating spindle and are forced radially inward by stationary rollers or cams within the machine housing, delivering high-frequency hammering blows (oscillations) to the workpiece surface as it is fed axially (infeed swaging) or formed in place (recess swaging).66 This action progressively reduces the outer diameter and, for tubes, can also modify the wall thickness and inner diameter, especially when a mandrel is used to control the internal shape.66 Rotary swaging is typically performed as a cold working process.66
Suitable Materials: The process demonstrates broad applicability across various metals, including commonly used shaft materials like carbon and alloy steels (e.g., 42CrMo, S355) 26, stainless steels (e.g., 316L) 27, aluminum alloys 65, magnesium alloys (AZ31) 25, titanium alloys, and even high-temperature superalloys like Inconel 718.26
Cost Factors: A significant advantage of rotary swaging is its near-net shape capability, which minimizes material waste and substantially reduces the need for subsequent machining operations compared to subtractive methods.67 The process lends itself well to automation, making it suitable for high-volume production.67 While tooling (dies and potentially mandrels) represents an investment, the efficiency gains from reduced material consumption and machining can lead to overall cost-effectiveness. Research into dry swaging (eliminating lubricants) using coated or structured tools aims to further reduce operational costs and environmental impact.65 The incremental nature often allows for relatively short process times.26
Subsequent Processing: Compared to drilling from solid or starting with a basic extruded tube, rotary swaging significantly reduces the required subsequent steps due to its near-net shape capability.26 However, finishing operations like grinding or honing might still be necessary to achieve the extremely fine tolerances and surface finishes required on critical surfaces like bearing journals or seal seats. Since it's typically a cold working process, a post-swaging heat treatment (e.g., stress relief annealing or full hardening/tempering cycle) is often required to optimize mechanical properties and relieve internal stresses. Trimming the ends of the swaged part may also be necessary.67
Achievable Quality: Rotary swaging is known for its ability to produce parts with high dimensional precision, achieving tolerance grades up to IT8 or IT9.26 It also generates smooth, high-quality surface finishes.26 Good control over complex external geometries like steps and tapers is possible, and internal profiles can be formed using mandrels.66 Geometric quality metrics like roundness deviation are key parameters monitored in the process.68
Mechanical Properties: As a cold working process, rotary swaging induces significant strain hardening, leading to substantial increases in material strength (tensile, yield, torsional) and hardness, particularly concentrated near the surface but also affecting the bulk material.25 This work hardening effect is directly linked to improvements in fatigue strength and fatigue life compared to the unprocessed or cast state. Studies have reported fatigue strength increases of 40% for swaged 316L stainless steel, 20% for swaged aluminum wire, 6-12.5% in bending fatigue for S355 steel, and significantly improved fatigue behavior for swaged AZ31 magnesium alloy and 42CrMo steel.25 The process can also lead to grain refinement.25 However, swaging also introduces residual stresses, which are often tensile at the surface and can fluctuate significantly.68 While generally improving fatigue initiation resistance, the reduced ductility and high residual stress in heavily cold-worked material might, in some cases, increase the rate of fatigue crack growth once a crack has initiated.26
Pros & Cons for NEV Shafts:
Pros: Excellent near-net shape capability for producing stepped or tapered hollow shafts efficiently; significantly enhances strength and fatigue life through controlled work hardening; achieves good dimensional accuracy and surface finish, reducing subsequent processing; high material utilization; suitable for automation and mass production.
Cons: Induces significant cold work and potentially high residual stresses, which must be managed (often requiring stress relief heat treatment); forming complex internal features requires mandrels, adding complexity; potential for non-uniform deformation and property distribution through the thickness.26
Rotary swaging presents a compelling combination of benefits for NEV hollow shaft production. Its ability to concurrently shape the component close to its final dimensions while significantly enhancing critical mechanical properties like strength and fatigue resistance through controlled cold deformation makes it particularly attractive.25 This dual advantage directly addresses the core requirements of high performance and manufacturing efficiency for NEV shafts, setting it apart from methods that either only shape (like drilling) or provide property enhancement as a separate step (like heat treatment after machining).
3.4. Flow Forming

Process Description: Flow forming, also known as shear forming or flow turning, is an advanced cold metal forming process used to manufacture precise, seamless hollow components.41 It starts with a tubular or cup-shaped preform (often produced by deep drawing, forging, or extrusion) which is placed over a rotating mandrel.41 A set of rollers (typically three) applies localized, high compressive pressure to the outer surface of the rotating preform.41 This pressure causes the material to plastically flow axially along the mandrel, resulting in a reduction of the wall thickness and a corresponding increase in the length of the component.41 The internal diameter and profile precisely replicate the mandrel's shape. The process can be 'forward,' where the material flows in the same direction as the rollers' axial feed, or 'reverse,' where the material flows opposite to the roller feed, typically used for open-ended tubes.41
Suitable Materials: Flow forming is applicable to a range of ductile metals, including various steels (carbon, alloy, stainless, Cr-Mo-V grades), aluminum alloys, copper alloys, nickel-based alloys, and titanium alloys.41
Cost Factors: The process boasts high material utilization due to its near-net shape nature, minimizing scrap.41 It can often produce complex profiles and varying wall thicknesses in a single operation, potentially eliminating the need for subsequent welding or extensive machining, thus saving costs.41 Tooling primarily consists of the high-precision mandrel and the rollers.41 While the initial investment in flow forming machinery can be substantial, the process is highly efficient and cost-effective for medium to high-volume production runs due to potentially fast cycle times and reduced secondary operations.41
Subsequent Processing: Flow forming often yields parts with high accuracy and excellent surface finish, minimizing the need for subsequent machining.41 However, depending on the degree of cold work imparted and the application's requirements, a post-forming heat treatment (such as stress relief annealing) might be necessary to restore ductility or manage residual stresses.70 Final machining operations may still be required to create specific features like external splines, keyways, or to achieve ultimate precision in localized tolerance zones.
Achievable Quality: Flow forming is renowned for its ability to achieve high levels of dimensional accuracy, including precise control over diameter, concentricity, straightness, and especially wall thickness uniformity.41 It produces seamless components with excellent internal surface finishes (Ra values around 0.6 µm or better replicating the mandrel surface have been cited 41), which can be advantageous for fluid flow or reducing stress concentrations.41
Mechanical Properties: Similar to rotary swaging, flow forming involves extensive cold working, which significantly increases the material's tensile strength, yield strength, and hardness through strain hardening.41 The process aligns and elongates the material's grain structure in the axial direction, which contributes to enhanced fatigue resistance and improved overall strength-to-weight ratio.41 However, this significant cold deformation also introduces substantial residual stresses into the component. The magnitude and distribution (compressive or tensile) of these stresses depend on process parameters like roller geometry, feed rate, rotational speed, and the percentage of thickness reduction, and require careful management for optimal performance, especially regarding fatigue and dimensional stability.70 Residual stress values ranging from +/- 400 MPa to +/- 800 MPa have been reported in flow-formed Cr-Mo-V steel tubes depending on the reduction percentage.70
Pros & Cons for NEV Shafts:
Pros: Excellent for producing highly precise, thin-walled, seamless hollow shafts; significantly enhances strength and fatigue properties through controlled cold work; achieves superior internal surface finish, potentially reducing or eliminating ID finishing steps; high material efficiency; well-suited for lightweighting and high-performance applications.
Cons: Requires a high-quality, dimensionally accurate preform (tube or cup); the high degree of cold work can significantly reduce ductility and necessitates careful management of residual stresses (often requiring stress relief); high initial capital investment for machinery.
Flow forming's capability to produce exceptionally precise, often thin-walled hollow components with enhanced mechanical strength and fatigue properties, coupled with excellent surface finish, positions it as a strong candidate for manufacturing NEV motor shafts.41 These attributes align directly with the critical requirements for lightweighting (thin walls), high rotational speed (precision, balance), and durability (strength, fatigue resistance) outlined in Section 2. The ability to achieve very smooth internal surfaces without secondary operations is a distinct advantage over methods like drilling, potentially reducing overall process complexity and cost for high-performance shafts.41
3.5. Welding/Joining (esp. Friction Welding)

Process Description: Instead of forming a shaft from a single piece of material, welding allows for the construction of a shaft by joining multiple sections together. These sections could be a pre-formed hollow tube joined to solid end pieces containing splines or bearing features, or joining sections made of different materials. While various welding methods exist, Rotary Friction Welding (RFW) is particularly relevant for shafts due to its unique characteristics.69 RFW is a solid-state joining process where one component is rotated at high speed relative to a stationary component while an axial force presses them together.69 Friction generates intense localized heat at the interface, causing the materials to plasticize. Once sufficient heat is generated (often controlled by time or material upset/burn-off), rotation stops abruptly, and a higher forging force is applied, creating a strong, forged metallurgical bond without melting the bulk material.69 This contrasts sharply with conventional fusion welding processes (like MIG, TIG, or arc welding), which involve melting the base materials (and often a filler metal), leading to solidification structures, larger heat-affected zones (HAZ), and a higher likelihood of defects like porosity or inclusions.30
Suitable Materials: RFW exhibits remarkable versatility in joining a wide range of similar and dissimilar metals. This includes various combinations of carbon steels, alloy steels, and stainless steels pertinent to shaft manufacturing.28 This capability allows for tailored designs, such as joining a corrosion-resistant stainless steel section to a high-strength alloy steel section. However, certain materials with high concentrations of elements like sulfur or lead (often added for machinability, e.g., 11xx, 12xx series steels) can pose challenges for achieving high-quality friction welds.60 Fusion welding processes are generally limited to materials considered readily weldable by conventional means.
Cost Factors: RFW offers significant potential for cost reduction, primarily through enabling the use of optimized materials. Expensive high-performance alloys can be used only where strictly necessary (e.g., for torque transmission or corrosion resistance), while less critical sections can be made from lower-cost materials like standard carbon steel.60 Savings of 50-60% on raw material costs have been suggested for certain applications by replacing portions of expensive alloy shafts with carbon steel via RFW.60 The process itself is very fast, with weld cycles often completed in a matter of seconds, making it suitable for high-volume production.71 It requires no filler metals or shielding gases, reducing consumable costs. Furthermore, joining easily machinable sections to harder or tougher sections can sometimes improve overall manufacturability and reduce tooling costs during subsequent machining.60 Fusion welding, conversely, involves costs for consumables (filler wire, gas) and is generally a slower process.
Subsequent Processing: RFW inherently produces an "upset" or "flash" of extruded plasticized material around the weld joint, which must be removed, typically by turning or shearing shortly after welding. Subsequent machining (turning, grinding) is necessary to bring the entire shaft, including the weld zone, to its final dimensions and tolerances.60 Depending on the materials joined and the performance requirements, a post-weld heat treatment (stress relief or a full hardening and tempering cycle) may be required to optimize properties and relieve stresses introduced by the welding thermal cycle.30 Fusion welds typically require more extensive post-weld cleaning and finishing, and stress relief is often mandatory, especially for fatigue-critical applications.30
Achievable Quality: RFW is known for producing exceptionally high-integrity joints with mechanical properties often approaching those of the parent materials.69 Because it's a solid-state process, it avoids melting-related defects common in fusion welds (porosity, solidification cracking, inclusions). The resulting Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) is typically much narrower and less detrimental to properties than that produced by fusion welding.60 The process is highly repeatable and controllable, leading to consistent joint quality.69 Good dimensional control, including alignment and concentricity between the joined parts, is achievable with proper tooling and machine setup.69 Fusion welds, in contrast, are inherently more susceptible to defects that can compromise joint integrity and performance, particularly under fatigue loading.30
Mechanical Properties: Joints produced by RFW generally exhibit excellent static strength and, crucially, superior fatigue performance compared to fusion welded joints.29 The solid-state nature of the bond and the narrow, refined microstructure in the weld zone contribute to this enhanced fatigue resistance. Studies have shown that RFW can even improve fatigue life compared to the base materials in certain dissimilar metal combinations.29 The properties within the narrow HAZ are typically less degraded than in the wider HAZ of fusion welds.60 Fusion welding, conversely, almost invariably leads to a significant reduction in fatigue strength compared to the parent material due to the combined effects of stress concentrations at the weld toe, potential defects acting as crack initiators, detrimental microstructural changes in the HAZ, and high tensile residual stresses.30
Pros & Cons for NEV Shafts:
Pros (RFW): Enables optimized material selection for cost and performance by joining dissimilar metals or sections; produces high-strength, high-fatigue-resistance joints superior to fusion welds; very fast cycle times suitable for mass production; high process consistency and reliability; eliminates consumables; narrow HAZ.
Cons (RFW): Requires specialized friction welding equipment; typically limited to joining components with circular cross-sections at the interface; requires a subsequent flash removal operation; post-weld heat treatment may be necessary.
Cons (Arc Welding): Generally unsuitable for joining primary load-carrying sections of high-performance, fatigue-critical NEV motor shafts due to significant degradation of fatigue life and susceptibility to defects.
Rotary Friction Welding transcends being merely a joining technique; it acts as a strategic enabler for optimizing NEV hollow motor shaft design and manufacture. Its unique ability to reliably join different steel grades (or even other metals) with high joint integrity allows designers to place high-cost, high-performance materials only where absolutely needed (e.g., the main torque-carrying section or bearing surfaces) while utilizing more economical materials elsewhere.60 This hybrid approach, difficult or impossible to achieve with monolithic shafts or unreliable with fusion welding, offers a powerful pathway to simultaneously improve performance (by using the best material for each function) and reduce overall cost, making RFW a highly valuable tool in the manufacturing portfolio for these demanding components.29
4. Analysis of Emerging Manufacturing Technologies

Beyond established methods, emerging technologies offer potential future pathways for manufacturing NEV components, although their current maturity and suitability for high-volume shaft production vary.

4.1. Additive Manufacturing (Metal AM)

Process Description: Additive Manufacturing (AM), colloquially known as 3D printing, constructs components directly from 3D model data by adding material layer upon layer, in contrast to traditional subtractive methods.20 For metals, common processes include Powder Bed Fusion (PBF), where a laser (PBF-LB or Selective Laser Melting - SLM) or electron beam (PBF-EB) selectively melts and fuses regions of a powder bed, and Directed Energy Deposition (DED), where focused thermal energy (laser or electric arc) melts material (powder or wire) as it is being deposited.74 AM offers unprecedented design freedom, enabling the creation of highly complex geometries, internal features, and optimized structures (e.g., topology optimization) that are difficult or impossible to produce using conventional methods.20
Suitable Materials: A growing range of metals and alloys can be processed via AM, including various grades of steel (tool steels, stainless steels, high-speed steels), titanium alloys, aluminum alloys, nickel-based superalloys (like Inconel), and cobalt-chrome alloys.74 Research is also actively exploring multi-material AM, allowing for the deposition of different materials within a single part.76
Cost Factors: Currently, the production cost using metal AM is generally higher than conventional manufacturing methods, especially for high-volume production.52 AM finds its economic advantage in applications involving low production volumes, rapid prototyping, highly customized parts, or components with extreme complexity where the high costs of traditional tooling (molds, dies) can be avoided.52 A significant contributor to the overall cost of AM parts is the high price of specialized metal powders or wires.52 While AM machine costs have been decreasing, they still represent a substantial capital investment.52 On the positive side, AM significantly reduces material waste compared to subtractive machining, as material is only added where needed (often referred to as "minimal waste" or "buy-to-fly ratio" improvement).20 It also eliminates the need for part-specific tooling, reducing lead times for initial production.20
Subsequent Processing: Metal AM parts typically require significant post-processing steps to achieve the final desired properties and tolerances. These commonly include removal from the build plate, removal of support structures (often necessary for overhanging features), heat treatments (for stress relief, homogenization, or achieving desired microstructure/hardness), and surface finishing operations (machining, grinding, polishing) to improve the inherently rough as-built surface finish and meet tight dimensional tolerances.20
Achievable Quality: The quality of AM parts presents challenges compared to conventionally manufactured components. The as-built surface finish is typically much rougher, which can act as initiation sites for fatigue cracks and negatively impact wear resistance.20 Internal defects, such as porosity (unmelted powder or gas entrapment) and lack of fusion between layers, can occur and significantly degrade mechanical properties, particularly fatigue strength.20 Dimensional accuracy and geometric tolerances may be lower than those achieved by machining or precision forming without extensive post-processing.76 Furthermore, the layer-by-layer building process and associated rapid heating/cooling cycles inherently introduce residual stresses, which can affect dimensional stability and mechanical performance.20
Mechanical Properties: The mechanical properties of AM metal parts are highly dependent on the specific process used, printing parameters, material composition, build orientation, and post-processing treatments. While static properties (tensile strength, yield strength) can sometimes reach levels comparable to wrought or cast counterparts after appropriate heat treatment 74, fatigue performance remains a major area of concern.20 The combination of surface roughness, internal defects (porosity), anisotropic microstructure (due to directional solidification), and residual stresses often leads to significantly lower fatigue life and greater variability compared to materials produced by traditional methods like forging or forming, unless substantial and costly post-processing (like Hot Isostatic Pressing - HIP, and surface machining/polishing) is employed.20
Current Applicability & Future Potential for NEV Shafts: Given the current state of the technology, metal AM is generally considered unsuitable for the mass production of safety-critical, high-fatigue components like NEV motor shafts. The primary barriers are the high production cost per part at scale, the significant challenges in consistently achieving the required high fatigue performance due to process-inherent features (roughness, defects, residual stress), and the need for extensive, costly post-processing.20 Its current role in this context is more likely limited to rapid prototyping of shaft designs, producing specialized tooling used in conventional manufacturing, or potentially for very low-volume, niche motorsport applications where cost is less critical and design complexity is high. Future potential for broader adoption hinges on significant advancements in reducing costs (materials, machines, processing speed), improving process control to minimize defects and enhance surface finish, developing more reliable methods for predicting and managing fatigue behavior, and streamlining post-processing requirements.20
The inherent process characteristics of current metal AM technologies present a significant obstacle – particularly concerning fatigue – for applications like NEV motor shafts.20 The rough as-built surfaces act as potent stress concentrators 23, while internal porosity provides initiation sites for cracks 75, and residual stresses further influence crack behavior.20 While AM's design freedom is appealing, the difficulty in guaranteeing consistent, high fatigue strength without resorting to extensive and expensive post-processing steps (which negate some of AM's cost benefits) makes it currently less viable than established high-performance forming methods for this specific high-volume, high-reliability automotive application, where fatigue resistance is a non-negotiable requirement.20
4.2. Hydroforming (Tube Hydroforming)

Process Description: Hydroforming is a metal forming process that utilizes high-pressure hydraulic fluid to shape metallic blanks, either sheet metal or tubes, against a die.78 For hollow shafts, Tube Hydroforming is the relevant variant. In this process, a tubular preform (often pre-bent) is placed inside a closed die cavity representing the desired final shape.56 The ends of the tube are sealed, and then a high-pressure fluid (typically water or oil) is injected into the tube.56 This internal pressure forces the tube walls outward to conform precisely to the shape of the die cavity. Often, axial cylinders simultaneously apply force to the tube ends, feeding material inward to help fill complex shapes, prevent excessive thinning, and control the forming process.80 This combination allows for the creation of complex hollow components with varying cross-sections, bulges, and branches, often in a single forming step.56 While typically a cold forming process, variants like "hot hydroforging" exist, performing the process at elevated temperatures (e.g., >1000°C for steel) to improve formability for less ductile materials or achieve intricate shapes without fracture.82 A key feature is the use of fluid pressure acting as one half of the 'die,' reducing tooling complexity compared to matched-die methods.57
Suitable Materials: Tube hydroforming is suitable for materials exhibiting good ductility, allowing them to be stretched and formed without tearing. Common materials include aluminum alloys, brass, copper, various grades of stainless steel, low to medium carbon steels, and some high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels.56 Material properties conducive to hydroforming include high and uniform elongation, a high strain hardening exponent (n-value), and low anisotropy (variation of properties with direction).81 Forming higher strength steels requires significantly higher fluid pressures and more robust equipment.
Cost Factors: Hydroforming offers several potential cost advantages. Tooling costs can be significantly lower (up to 50% reduction cited compared to deep drawing) because only one complex die half (the outer cavity) is typically required, with the fluid pressure acting as the internal 'punch'.56 The process excels at part consolidation, allowing complex components that might otherwise require multiple stampings and subsequent welding/assembly to be formed in a single piece, reducing downstream labor, fixture, and welding costs.56 This also leads to improved structural integrity and potentially lighter weight compared to fabricated assemblies.57 Material utilization is generally good, and the process can sometimes allow for the use of thinner starting blanks while achieving the required stiffness through optimized geometry.56 Hydroforming can achieve significant shape changes in a single press cycle, potentially reducing the number of forming steps compared to traditional methods like deep drawing.57 Development costs may also be reduced due to the relative flexibility in modifying the process parameters (pressure profiles, axial feed) without needing entirely new hard tooling for minor design adjustments.57 However, cycle times can sometimes be longer than high-speed stamping, and the capital investment for hydroforming presses (especially high-pressure ones) can be substantial.
Subsequent Processing: A major benefit of hydroforming is the potential reduction in secondary operations, particularly welding and assembly, due to part consolidation.56 The surface finish achieved is generally good, often replicating the die surface quality and potentially reducing the need for extensive polishing or finishing compared to methods like stamping that can leave tool marks.56 However, subsequent operations like trimming excess material, piercing holes or features, and end-forming might still be necessary. Depending on the material and the amount of deformation (cold work), a post-forming heat treatment could be required.
Achievable Quality: Hydroforming is capable of producing parts with complex geometries while maintaining high dimensional accuracy and tight tolerances.56 The uniform application of pressure helps minimize localized thinning and wrinkling compared to some stamping operations.79 It results in good surface quality, free from the scratches or blemishes sometimes associated with mechanical forming methods.56 The process can improve the stiffness and structural integrity of components compared to equivalent parts fabricated from multiple pieces.57 Work hardening effects are generally considered lower than in processes involving more severe, localized deformation.57
Mechanical Properties: The process generally preserves or slightly enhances the base material properties. While some work hardening occurs, it's typically less pronounced than in severe cold working processes like flow forming or swaging.57 The primary benefit often comes from achieving optimized geometries that enhance structural stiffness and strength.57 Hot hydroforging allows forming at temperatures above recrystallization, influencing the final microstructure and avoiding significant cold work effects.82 Final properties are a function of the starting material, the forming parameters, and any subsequent heat treatments.
Current Applicability & Future Potential for NEV Shafts: Tube hydroforming is already widely adopted in the automotive industry, primarily for manufacturing structural components like chassis members (engine cradles, frame rails), suspension arms, and exhaust system parts, where its ability to create lightweight, stiff, complex shapes and consolidate parts offers significant advantages.57 Its application specifically to high-strength, precision hollow motor shafts requires careful evaluation. While it can form stepped hollow shafts 80, challenges may arise in achieving the very tight tolerances required for bearing seats and maintaining uniform wall thickness in thick-walled sections typical of motor shafts. Furthermore, forming the high-strength alloy steels often used for shafts requires extremely high fluid pressures, demanding robust and expensive equipment. Cycle times might also be a concern for the very high volumes required. While hot hydroforging could address formability issues with stronger steels 82, it adds significant complexity related to heating and thermal management. Therefore, while technically feasible, hydroforming might face stiff competition from the potentially more efficient rotary swaging or flow forming processes for producing the relatively simpler (compared to chassis components) stepped axisymmetric geometries typical of NEV motor shafts. Its potential might be greater if the shaft design incorporates highly complex, non-axisymmetric features or requires integration of branches or bulges not easily achievable by other methods.
Hydroforming's established success in automotive structures stems from its strength in creating complex, often non-axisymmetric, lightweight components through part consolidation.56 However, applying it to NEV motor shafts, which are primarily axisymmetric and demand very high precision and strength, might represent a niche application. Processes like rotary swaging and flow forming are inherently well-suited and highly efficient for producing precise, variable-diameter axisymmetric hollow parts.26 Unless the motor shaft design incorporates unique geometric complexities that specifically leverage hydroforming's capabilities, the high pressures needed for strong steels and potentially longer cycle times compared to incremental methods could make it less economically competitive in a mass production scenario for typical shaft geometries.
5. Comparative Evaluation of Manufacturing Routes

Choosing the optimal manufacturing route for NEV hollow motor shafts requires a careful comparison of the analyzed technologies across technical, economic, and process chain criteria, keeping the specific requirements of high-volume, high-performance automotive production in mind.

5.1. Technical Capability Comparison

Dimensional Accuracy & Tolerances: Flow forming and rotary swaging stand out for their ability to achieve high precision (potentially IT6-IT9 range) directly from the forming process, particularly for diameter, wall thickness, straightness, and concentricity.26 Cold extrusion also offers good accuracy for the initial tube preform.63 Deep hole drilling requires subsequent finishing (honing, burnishing) to reach the highest levels of ID accuracy.48 Hydroforming provides good accuracy, suitable for many applications, but might not match the inherent precision of flow forming or swaging for demanding shaft tolerances without additional finishing.56 Additive Manufacturing generally requires extensive post-machining to meet tight tolerances typical of shafts.74 Friction welding itself doesn't define overall shaft tolerance, which depends on the accuracy of the joined components and post-weld machining.60
Surface Finish: Flow forming typically produces the best as-formed surface finish, especially on the internal diameter replicating the mandrel.41 Rotary swaging also yields smooth surfaces.26 Cold extrusion provides a better finish than hot extrusion.63 Hydroforming generally results in good surface quality, often superior to stamping.56 Deep hole drilling requires secondary operations for the finest finishes needed for seals/bearings.48 AM produces the roughest as-built surface, necessitating significant finishing.20 Welded areas require finishing. The importance of surface finish extends beyond fit and wear; it critically impacts fatigue life.21
Mechanical Properties (Achieved State): Cold working processes like flow forming and rotary swaging significantly enhance strength, hardness, and fatigue resistance through strain hardening and grain structure refinement, but also introduce potentially high residual stresses that need management.25 Cold extrusion has a similar effect.63 Friction welding creates strong joints with minimal HAZ degradation, preserving or even enhancing fatigue properties compared to fusion methods.29 Deep hole drilling does not inherently modify bulk properties; performance relies on the base material and subsequent heat treatment. AM properties are highly process-dependent and variable, with fatigue performance being a primary challenge requiring mitigation through post-processing.20 Hot processes like hot extrusion or hot hydroforging result in annealed or recrystallized microstructures with generally lower strength unless followed by heat treatment.63
Material Suitability: Most conventional forming processes (extrusion, swaging, flow forming, hydroforming) are suitable for the high-strength carbon and alloy steels typically used for NEV shafts, although formability limits exist, especially for cold working processes with high strength materials. Deep hole drilling is highly versatile across materials.45 AM offers potential for a wide range of alloys, but process maturity and property validation vary.74 Friction welding excels at joining dissimilar steel grades, offering unique design flexibility.28
Complexity Handling: AM provides the greatest geometric freedom but comes with significant drawbacks in quality and cost for this application.20 Hydroforming is well-suited for complex, potentially non-axisymmetric hollow shapes.56 Rotary swaging effectively produces axisymmetric parts with steps, tapers, and, using mandrels, internal features.66 Flow forming is excellent for precise cylindrical parts with varying wall thicknesses and complex longitudinal profiles.41 Extrusion is primarily limited to producing constant cross-section tubes.63 Deep hole drilling creates straight cylindrical holes. Welding joins pre-shaped components.
5.2. Economic Viability Comparison

Cost Structure:
Tooling: Tooling costs are eliminated in AM, but machine costs are high.53 Hydroforming requires one complex die, potentially lowering costs vs. matched dies.56 Extrusion, swaging, and flow forming require dedicated dies/mandrels, the cost of which is amortized over production volume.41 Drilling uses consumable tools.46 Friction welding requires robust fixtures but no forming dies.71
Material Utilization: Near-net shape processes like flow forming, rotary swaging, and hydroforming offer high material efficiency.41 AM also minimizes waste compared to subtractive methods.20 Friction welding allows optimized material use by joining sections.60 Deep hole drilling from solid bar has extremely poor material utilization. Extrusion efficiency depends on the overall process chain.
Cycle Time: Processes like rotary swaging, flow forming, and friction welding can offer fast cycle times suitable for mass production.26 Extrusion (for tubes) is also fast. Deep hole drilling (especially gun drilling) and AM tend to be slower processes.48 Hydroforming cycle times vary with part complexity and pressure requirements.
Labor & Automation: Most established forming and joining processes are highly amenable to automation, reducing labor costs in mass production.67 AM currently often requires more manual intervention for post-processing.
Energy: Hot working processes (hot extrusion, hot hydroforging) have significant energy demands for heating.63 AM energy consumption varies widely depending on the specific process and machine.53 Cold working processes consume energy primarily for mechanical deformation.
Volume Suitability: For the high volumes characteristic of NEV production, rotary swaging, flow forming, extrusion (as a preform step) combined with subsequent finishing, and friction welding (as a joining step) are generally well-suited. Deep hole drilling from solid is less competitive due to material waste and potentially longer cycle times. AM is currently best suited for prototypes and very low volumes.53 Hydroforming's suitability for high volume depends on achieving competitive cycle times for the specific shaft design.
5.3. Process Chain Complexity (Subsequent Steps)

Evaluating the true cost and efficiency of a manufacturing route necessitates considering the entire sequence of operations from raw material to finished part.

Near-net shape processes like rotary swaging, flow forming, and potentially hydroforming aim to minimize the extent of subsequent machining and finishing operations by producing parts closer to the final geometry and often with good surface quality.26 This simplification of the downstream process chain can lead to significant overall cost and lead time reductions.
Conversely, methods starting far from the net shape, like deep hole drilling from solid bar, require extensive subsequent steps, including machining the entire outer profile and finishing the inner bore.48 Similarly, using extrusion only to create the initial tube necessitates a full suite of subsequent machining operations to create the final shaft features.
Additive manufacturing, despite its near-net shape potential in forming, currently demands extensive post-processing, including support removal, surface finishing (to address roughness and improve fatigue), heat treatment, and potentially HIP, adding significant complexity and cost to the overall workflow.20
Welding processes, including friction welding, inherently require post-weld operations such as flash removal (for RFW) and machining across the joint area to ensure dimensional accuracy and smooth transitions.60
Therefore, a holistic assessment of manufacturing routes is crucial. An initial forming step that appears low-cost in isolation (e.g., simple hot extrusion of a tube) might prove expensive overall if it mandates numerous, complex, and time-consuming downstream operations (extensive multi-axis machining, grinding, honing) to meet the final tight specifications for geometry, tolerance, and surface finish required for NEV shafts.33 Conversely, a potentially higher initial investment in a forming process like flow forming or rotary swaging, which delivers a near-net shape part with enhanced properties and superior finish, could be more economical when the total process chain—including the reduced need for subsequent steps—is considered. The interdependency between the primary forming method and the required post-processing steps is a critical factor in determining the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturing strategy for mass production.

6. Recommendations for Mass Production

Based on the comprehensive analysis of requirements, established technologies, and emerging methods, the following recommendations are made for selecting manufacturing routes for the mass production of hollow motor shafts for NEV electric drive units.

6.1. Evaluation of Trade-offs for High-Volume NEV Shafts

The selection process involves navigating critical trade-offs inherent in manufacturing high-performance components at automotive scale:

Performance vs. Cost: Processes that inherently enhance mechanical properties, particularly fatigue strength (like rotary swaging and flow forming through cold work), offer performance advantages but may require careful control of residual stresses and potentially stress relief treatments, adding cost. Methods relying solely on base material properties and heat treatment (like drilling from solid) might seem simpler but fail to leverage potential process-induced strengthening and face high material costs.
Near-Net Shape Efficiency vs. Investment/Complexity: Near-net shape processes (swaging, flow forming, hydroforming) significantly reduce material waste and downstream machining, leading to potentially lower overall costs despite potentially higher initial investment in specialized equipment. Processes far from net shape (drilling from solid, extrusion requiring extensive machining) incur substantial material and machining costs.
Process-Induced Properties vs. Heat Treatment/Finishing: Cold working processes induce strength but require managing residual stress and potentially reduced ductility, often necessitating post-forming heat treatments. Processes yielding softer material states require comprehensive heat treatment to meet final specifications. The need for ultra-fine surface finishes on bearing/seal surfaces often mandates dedicated grinding/honing/burnishing regardless of the primary forming method's finish capability.
Material Flexibility vs. Process Limitations: While methods like drilling or AM offer broad material compatibility, forming processes have limitations based on material ductility and strength (especially cold forming). Friction welding uniquely enables joining dissimilar materials, offering tailored material placement.
6.2. Recommended Primary Manufacturing Route(s) and Justification

Considering the paramount importance of fatigue performance, dimensional accuracy, lightweighting, and cost-effectiveness for high-volume NEV hollow motor shafts, the analysis strongly points towards Rotary Swaging and Flow Forming as the most suitable primary manufacturing routes.

Recommendation 1: Rotary Swaging
Justification: Rotary swaging offers an excellent balance of near-net shape forming for typical stepped hollow shaft geometries, achieving good dimensional tolerances (IT8-IT9) and surface finish directly from the process.26 Crucially, it significantly enhances material strength and fatigue life through controlled cold work hardening.25 Combined with high material utilization efficiency and suitability for automation, it presents a cost-effective solution for mass production that meets the demanding performance requirements of NEV shafts.65
Recommendation 2: Flow Forming
Justification: Flow forming excels in producing highly precise, seamless hollow shafts, particularly advantageous where thin walls (for lightweighting) and exceptional dimensional control (concentricity, wall uniformity) are critical.41 It yields superior surface finishes, especially on the internal diameter, potentially reducing or eliminating the need for ID finishing operations.41 Like swaging, it significantly enhances strength and fatigue properties through cold work.41 Its high material efficiency and suitability for complex longitudinal profiles make it another top contender for high-performance NEV shafts.41
Justification Against Other Methods (as primary route):
Deep Hole Drilling: Unsuitable for mass production due to excessive material waste and the need for extensive subsequent machining, leading to high overall costs [Insight 3].
Extrusion: Best utilized as an upstream process to create high-quality seamless tube preforms for subsequent swaging, flow forming, or machining, rather than as the primary shaping method for the final complex shaft [Insight 4].
Additive Manufacturing: Currently hindered by high costs, process variability, significant fatigue performance concerns, and the requirement for extensive post-processing, making it non-viable for mass-produced, safety-critical NEV shafts at present [Insight 8].
Hydroforming: While capable of complex shapes, likely less efficient and potentially more costly for the typical axisymmetric geometries of motor shafts compared to the specialized capabilities of swaging or flow forming, especially considering the high pressures needed for high-strength steels [Insight 9].
Arc Welding: Inappropriate for joining critical load-bearing sections due to the significant reduction in fatigue strength and potential for defects.30
6.3. Considerations for Hybrid Approaches or Future Technology Adoption

Hybrid Approach with Friction Welding: A highly promising strategy involves integrating Rotary Friction Welding (RFW) into the manufacturing route. This allows for optimized designs where, for example, complex end features (splines, bearing seats) manufactured efficiently via forging, swaging, or flow forming can be joined to a simpler, high-quality hollow tube section (produced via extrusion, flow forming, or swaging). This hybrid approach leverages RFW's ability to join dissimilar materials reliably and cost-effectively, enabling the strategic placement of materials based on function (e.g., high-strength alloy for torque, wear-resistant material for bearings, lower-cost steel for less stressed areas), potentially offering the best combination of performance, weight, and cost.60
Future Technology Monitoring: While not currently recommended for mass production, advancements in Additive Manufacturing should be continuously monitored. Improvements in process speed, cost reduction (especially materials), defect control, surface finish, and fatigue life prediction could eventually make AM viable for certain shaft applications, particularly those demanding extreme geometric complexity.20 Similarly, developments in Hydroforming, especially hot hydroforging for high-strength steels or techniques enabling faster cycle times, could increase its applicability for specific complex shaft designs.82
7. Conclusion

The manufacturing of hollow motor shafts for New Energy Vehicle electric drive units presents a complex challenge, requiring processes that can deliver high strength, exceptional fatigue resistance, precise dimensional control, and lightweighting, all within the economic constraints of automotive mass production. Key requirements include the use of high-strength alloy or case-hardening steels, tight tolerances (IT6-IT9) on critical diameters and geometric features, fine surface finishes (Ra < 0.8 µm) on bearing/seal surfaces, and a design capable of withstanding high speeds (≥20,000 rpm) and cyclic torque loads for extended lifetimes (>10^7 cycles).

Comparative analysis reveals that established cold forming processes, namely Rotary Swaging and Flow Forming, are the most suitable primary manufacturing routes. Both methods offer near-net shape capabilities, resulting in high material utilization and reduced subsequent machining. Crucially, they enhance the material's mechanical properties, particularly fatigue strength, through controlled work hardening, directly addressing a critical performance requirement. Rotary swaging is highly effective for stepped axisymmetric shafts, while flow forming excels in producing precise, thin-walled seamless components with superior surface finish.

Rotary Friction Welding stands out as a vital enabling technology, facilitating hybrid shaft designs that optimize material usage and cost by joining different materials or pre-formed sections with high integrity. Integrating RFW with swaging or flow forming represents a powerful strategy for achieving optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.

Other established methods like deep hole drilling from solid bar are deemed too inefficient due to material waste, while extrusion primarily serves as a method for producing intermediate tube preforms. Emerging technologies like Additive Manufacturing currently face significant hurdles related to cost, fatigue consistency, and post-processing for this high-volume application. Hydroforming, while widely used for structural parts, may be less competitive than swaging or flow forming for typical motor shaft geometries unless unique complexities are involved.

Therefore, for the mass production of NEV hollow motor shafts, adopting Rotary Swaging or Flow Forming, potentially in combination with Rotary Friction Welding, is recommended to best meet the demanding technical specifications and economic imperatives of the modern automotive industry. Continued monitoring of advancements in AM and hydroforming is advisable for potential future applications.
