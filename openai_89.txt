Advances and Frameworks in Modern Game Design
Game design theory has rapidly evolved in recent years, integrating academic research and industry trends. The classical Mechanics–Dynamics–Aesthetics (MDA) framework still provides a foundational vocabulary: mechanics are the formal rules and components of a game, dynamics their runtime behavior, and aesthetics the emotional responses they provoke (Redefining the MDA Framework—The Pursuit of a Game Design Ontology) (Redefining the MDA Framework—The Pursuit of a Game Design Ontology). However, scholars note that MDA’s definitions can be vague and incomplete: for example, Junior & Silva (2021) point out that original MDA “leaves narrative, graphics, [and] sound” outside its scope ([Redefining the MDA Framework—The Pursuit of a Game Design Ontology](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/10/395#:~:text=Although somewhat accepted in the,more useful for game designers)). As a result, modern frameworks extend or refine MDA. For instance, the DDE (Design–Dynamics–Experience) framework recasts MDA with a player-centric focus: Walk et al. (2017) describe DDE as improving MDA by explicitly including the player’s experience in design ([Design, Dynamics, Experience (DDE): An Advancement of the MDA Framework for Game Design | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-53088-8_3#:~:text=Although the Mechanics%2C Dynamics and,of computer and video games)). Similarly, Winn’s Design–Play–Experience (DPE) model reframes games in educational contexts as “Designer designs, player plays, resulting in the player’s Experience” ([Redefining the MDA Framework—The Pursuit of a Game Design Ontology](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/10/395#:~:text=Winn ,is not clear how four)). Other recent proposals Redefine MDA (RMDA) by clarifying its components for designers ([Redefining the MDA Framework—The Pursuit of a Game Design Ontology](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/10/395#:~:text=Although

Key contemporary frameworks now include inclusive and user-focused models. The Geena Davis Institute’s Playbook for Inclusive Game Design (2025) is explicitly framed as a design framework to “understand, reflect, and address possible bias in narratives and character development” ([Inclusive Game Design - Geena Davis Institute](https://geenadavisinstitute.org/inclusive-game-design-playbook/#:~:text=The GDI Playbook%3A A Framework,for Inclusive Game Development)). In serious and educational gaming, new methodologies abound: for example, Bunt et al. (2024) propose a stakeholder-centered design framework that integrates stakeholder analysis and enterprise architecture to guide serious game projects ([JMIR Serious Games - Enhancing Serious Game Design: Expert-Reviewed, Stakeholder-Centered Framework](https://games.jmir.org/2024/1/e48099/#:~:text=Background%3A Traditional serious game design,serious game design and implementation)). Likewise, Marne et al.’s Six Facets model and game-design pattern libraries help coordinate multidisciplinary teams in serious game creation (each facet corresponds to roles like pedagogy or technology). In summary, researchers and industry are both expanding on MDA with frameworks that incorporate player experience, social context, learning objectives, and ethical considerations.

MDA Framework and Evolving Theories
The MDA framework remains deeply influential but also widely critiqued. Authors of the original MDA paper warn that “even small changes in mechanics can cascade” into complex game dynamics and emergent gameplay ([Revisiting the MDA framework](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/revisiting-the-mda-framework#:~:text=The MDA authors are especially,3)), illustrating how designers use MDA to analyze cause-effect. At the same time, modern critics note MDA’s gaps. Junior & Silva (2021) observe that MDA is “mostly used in universities” and that its concepts “lack scrutiny and accuracy”, prompting calls to extend it for real-world design ([Redefining the MDA Framework—The Pursuit of a Game Design Ontology](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/10/395#:~:text=Although somewhat accepted in the,more useful for game designers)). They emphasize adding factors like narrative, graphics, interface, and socio-cultural context. Similarly, game designer discourse has spawned new proposals: Walk et al.’s DDE explicitly replaces “Mechanics” with “Design” and “Aesthetics” with “Experience” to highlight authorial intent ([Design, Dynamics, Experience (DDE): An Advancement of the MDA Framework for Game Design | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-53088-8_3#:~:text=Although the Mechanics%2C Dynamics and,of computer and video games)), and Winn’s DPE (and its later expansion for learning) interposes the concept of Play between design and experience ([Redefining the MDA Framework—The Pursuit of a Game Design Ontology](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/10/395#:~:text=Winn ,is not clear how four)). Other academic efforts include ontological studies (e.g. redefining MDA’s taxonomy ([Redefining the MDA Framework—The Pursuit of a Game Design Ontology](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/10/395#:~:text=Although

Design-Experience Relationship: Frameworks like DDE/DPE center the player’s experience (for example, DDE explicitly ties design decisions to player experience ([Design, Dynamics, Experience (DDE): An Advancement of the MDA Framework for Game Design | SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-53088-8_3#:~:text=Although the Mechanics%2C Dynamics and,of computer and video games))).
Serious/Educational Extensions: Models such as the Six Facets for serious games or the GOM v2 expand classic game constructs to include learning goals, storytelling, and social spaces. Bunt et al.’s stakeholder framework stresses aligning game design with stakeholder needs and educational standards ([JMIR Serious Games - Enhancing Serious Game Design: Expert-Reviewed, Stakeholder-Centered Framework](https://games.jmir.org/2024/1/e48099/#:~:text=Background%3A Traditional serious game design,serious game design and implementation)).
Emotional & Inclusive Focus: Recent work (e.g. the Polaris design retreat) provides practical steps for embedding intended emotions into mechanics ([There is No Wheel: A Framework for Creating Emotionally Resonant Game Mechanics – Polaris Game Design Retreat](https://polarisgamedesign.com/2024/there-is-no-wheel/#:~:text=At Polaris 2024%2C our group,will be a valuable tool)). The GDI Playbook (2025) formalizes inclusive design checks (gender, disability, etc.) as a structured process for creative teams ([Inclusive Game Design - Geena Davis Institute](https://geenadavisinstitute.org/inclusive-game-design-playbook/#:~:text=The GDI Playbook%3A A Framework,for Inclusive Game Development)).
Design Patterns and Lenses: Besides high-level frameworks, the industry still uses tools like Jesse Schell’s “Lenses”, which pose design questions (though these are analysis tools more than comprehensive models). There is also growing interest in game design patterns (e.g. libraries of mechanics and dynamics) and core-loop analysis, which serve as mini-frameworks for designers.
Overall, theory is moving beyond static MDA layers towards dynamic, layered, and multidisciplinary frameworks that reflect complex modern games (see Table below for examples).

Video Games: Modern Trends & MDA in Practice
(Download Gamepad, Controller, Colorful. Royalty-Free Stock Illustration Image - Pixabay) Figure: Modern video games blend technical innovation with design theory. Designers increasingly use AI tools (e.g. GPT) for content generation ([GPT for Games: An Updated Scoping Review (2020-2024)](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00308v1#:~:text=Due to GPT’s impressive generative,areas and emerging research%2C we)) and apply design frameworks like MDA to ensure engaging player experiences ([Revisiting the MDA framework](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/revisiting-the-mda-framework#:~:text=The MDA authors are especially,3)). In the video-game industry, cutting-edge trends have shaped design practices. A major trend is AI-driven design: recent surveys show that LLMs (e.g. GPT) are now being explored for “procedural content generation, mixed-initiative game design, [and] mixed-initiative gameplay” as well as NPC dialogue and player modeling ([GPT for Games: An Updated Scoping Review (2020-2024)](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00308v1#:~:text=Due

Another trend is social and inclusive gameplay. For example, the Geena Davis Institute’s new Inclusive Playbook provides designers with checklists to eliminate bias in characters and stories ([Inclusive Game Design - Geena Davis Institute](https://geenadavisinstitute.org/inclusive-game-design-playbook/#:~:text=The GDI Playbook%3A A Framework,for Inclusive Game Development)). Major studios (Ubisoft, Activision, etc.) have endorsed such guidelines, recognizing that broader representation leads to “a more dynamic and engaging experience” for diverse audiences ([Inclusive Game Design - Geena Davis Institute](https://geenadavisinstitute.org/inclusive-game-design-playbook/#:~:text=The

In practice, many modern video games still apply the core MDA logic: designers manipulate mechanics to elicit desired dynamics and aesthetics. For instance, in an open-world RPG the core mechanics (combat rules, crafting system) produce emergent dynamics (trade economies, alliances), which deliver aesthetics of discovery and challenge ([Revisiting the MDA framework](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/revisiting-the-mda-framework#:~:text=The MDA authors are especially,3)). Game designers use analytic tools to ensure the chain of influence from mechanics to player experience stays intact. Some contemporary design talks explicitly reframe MDA: e.g. the 2025 microlearning blog shows corporate trainers mapping Mechanics (quizzes, badges) to Dynamics (competition, cooperation) to achieve Aesthetics (mastery, motivation) ([How the MDA Framework Enhances Microlearning Game Design | by MaxLearn Microlearning Platform | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://maxlearn-microlearning.medium.com/how-the-mda-framework-enhances-microlearning-game-design-84708d2a3783#:~:text=1,sense of accomplishment%2C mastery%2C or)), illustrating how MDA principles are repurposed outside pure entertainment.

Key examples of MDA-inspired practice in video games include:

Live-Service Games: Games-as-a-service use iterative design loops (new seasons, events) where MDA helps plan how new mechanics (game modes, rewards) will sustain dynamics (player engagement, social play) and aesthetics (surprise, community) over time.
Narrative Games: Designers of story-driven games are adapting MDA by adding narrative as a linked factor. For example, Husserl’s “narrative dynamics” treat story beats as part of the dynamic layer that generate emotional outcomes, bridging MDA with narrative design.
Flow and Psychology: While not new, Csíkszentmihályi’s flow theory and behavioral design (e.g. self-determination theory) are being integrated with MDA to create games that satisfy mastery, autonomy, and relatedness needs. Some designers view these as meta-lenses on top of MDA’s layers.
In summary, video game design today merges MDA-style systemic thinking with data-driven tools. Designers frequently test mechanics (via prototypes or analytics) to tune the dynamics and aesthetics. At the same time, new guidelines (inclusive playbooks, ethical frameworks) and AI-assisted design are shaping how those systems are created. The emphasis is on flexible, player-centered design while maintaining the rigorous structural insight that frameworks like MDA provide.

Tabletop Games: Modern Board Game Design
(Figures Playing Board Game - Free photo on Pixabay) Figure: Contemporary board games use rich mechanics (dice, cards, pawns) and design frameworks. Researchers propose tailored design processes (e.g. MBGTOTEACH ([ Mastering Modern Board Game Design to Build New Learning Experiences: the MBGTOTEACH Framework | The International Journal of Games and Social Impact ](https://revistas.ulusofona.pt/index.php/ijgsi/article/view/8516#:~:text=Games have proven to be,recognize how to explore games’))) while drawing on MDA-like analysis for tabletop play. The board/tabletop game scene has surged in popularity, and designers have adapted both academic frameworks and inventive methods. Unlike video games, tabletop games must account for physical components and face-to-face social dynamics, but analogous principles apply. Recent work shows educators using analog games strategically: Sousa (2023) introduces the MBGTOTEACH framework to help teachers “adapt and develop modern board games” for learning ([ Mastering Modern Board Game Design to Build New Learning Experiences: the MBGTOTEACH Framework | The International Journal of Games and Social Impact ](https://revistas.ulusofona.pt/index.php/ijgsi/article/view/8516#:~:text=Games

Researchers have also created frameworks specific to tabletop purposes. Epstein et al. (2021) conducted a realist review of board-game elements for health behavior change, proposing a game design framework that aligns board-game mechanics with psychological interventions. For cooperative tabletop games, Pais et al. (2023) developed a Living Framework for Cooperative Games categorizing elements like Forms of Cooperation and Play Structures. These specialized frameworks reflect the diversity of tabletop design (competitive vs. cooperative, legacy vs. abstract).

In current board game practice, designers often use informal frameworks like game design patterns (libraries of common mechanics such as “worker placement” or “deck-building”) and component analysis (evaluating rule complexity and components cost). Published interviews note that many veteran board-game designers implicitly use MDA ideas by considering how rule changes lead to emergent player interactions (dynamics) and table experiences (aesthetics). Indeed, the MDA perspective has even been applied to analogue games: Duarte (2015) asks “Can MDA be expanded for non-digital games?”, noting that board game mechanics similarly cascade into unexpected dynamics ([Revisiting the MDA framework](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/revisiting-the-mda-framework#:~:text=The MDA authors are especially,3)).

Examples in tabletop design include: eurogame versus ameritrash design debates (more deterministic vs. more thematic goals), legacy-game frameworks (rules that evolve over sessions), and dexterity or card-driven game mechanics. Although not formalized as MDA, such design considerations echo the same concepts: e.g. a new dice-rolling mechanic will change pacing (dynamic) and shift players’ excitement (aesthetic). Overall, tabletop designers are borrowing from digital game theory (e.g. studying MDA in analysis) while also innovating board-specific processes. The key trend is cross-pollination: digital design frameworks inform tabletop games, and successful board game principles (e.g. easy-to-learn rules that still allow emergent depth) are influencing video game prototyping.

Educational and Serious Games
In educational and serious game design, MDA and its offshoots are combined with pedagogical frameworks. Many educational designers begin with learning objectives and map them into game mechanics. For example, Viudes-Carbonell et al. propose treating educational concepts as the “building blocks” of game mechanics, essentially layering MDA under pedagogical schemas ([Redefining the MDA Framework—The Pursuit of a Game Design Ontology](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/10/395#:~:text=Recently%2C Viudes,the dynamics and aesthetics out)). Winn’s DPE (Design-Play-Experience) specifically addresses serious learning games: the author frames design as creating challenges (Mechanics) and guides how those lead to learning experiences ([Redefining the MDA Framework—The Pursuit of a Game Design Ontology](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/10/395#:~:text=Winn ,is not clear how four)). Similarly, Amory’s Game Object Model 2 integrates pedagogical constructs into game components, although such models can be complex for non-technical teams ([Redefining the MDA Framework—The Pursuit of a Game Design Ontology](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/10/395#:~:text=process. For example%2C Amory ,too theoretical and not easy)).

Recent frameworks for serious games emphasize stakeholder and process alignment. Bunt et al. (2024) integrate stakeholder theory into a design science framework, where needs analysis and expert review guide game development stages ([JMIR Serious Games - Enhancing Serious Game Design: Expert-Reviewed, Stakeholder-Centered Framework](https://games.jmir.org/2024/1/e48099/#:~:text=Background%3A Traditional serious game design,serious game design and implementation)). Marne et al.’s “Six Facets” framework breaks down serious game design into facets (e.g. domain expert, pedagogy), supported by a pattern library to solve design problems. Other gamification frameworks (Octalysis by Yu-kai Chou, PBL – Problem-Based Learning models) are often used in tandem with MDA thinking to ensure motivational elements are present.

In practice, educational games apply MDA by carefully aligning mechanics to educational goals: e.g. a math learning game might use quizzes and puzzles (mechanics) to create competition or curiosity (dynamics) and evoke satisfaction of mastering a skill (aesthetics). The 2025 microlearning example explicitly repurposes MDA’s layers for corporate training, listing mechanics (badges, timers), dynamics (exploration, competition), and aesthetics (mastery, motivation) in a learning context ([How the MDA Framework Enhances Microlearning Game Design | by MaxLearn Microlearning Platform | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://maxlearn-microlearning.medium.com/how-the-mda-framework-enhances-microlearning-game-design-84708d2a3783#:~:text=1,sense of accomplishment%2C mastery%2C or)). This reflects a broader trend: even outside entertainment, designers find MDA a useful checklist for balancing content (rules) and experience.

Example: Foldit (a famous protein-folding game) and Classcraft (a classroom RPG) demonstrate how educational games intertwine gameplay with learning metrics. Designers of such games often iterate mechanics based on player feedback data (analytics), tuning dynamics (difficulty curves) to achieve engagement aesthetics (flow of learning). In summary, educational game design is evolving through hybrid frameworks: it borrows MDA for structuring gameplay while also employing pedagogical taxonomies, usability heuristics, and iterative prototyping to meet learning outcomes.

Emerging Tools and Trends
Beyond frameworks, several cutting-edge trends are reshaping game design practice:

AI and Procedural Design: As noted, generative AI (GPT-4, etc.) is now a mainstream tool. A 2024 literature review found 131 papers on “GPT for games”, highlighting uses in procedural content generation (levels, maps, dialogue), mixed-initiative development (AI co-designing levels with humans), adaptive gameplay, and even AI as game testers ([GPT for Games: An Updated Scoping Review (2020-2024)](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.00308v1#:~:text=Due to GPT’s impressive generative,areas and emerging research%2C we)). In industry, engines like Unity and Unreal are integrating ML tools for environment generation and NPC behavior. Designers must now consider AI behaviors as part of game dynamics, introducing new mechanics (e.g. machine-assisted NPC pathfinding) that can profoundly affect aesthetics (greater variability, personalization).
Player-Centric Data and Iteration: Live analytics and A/B testing (especially in mobile and live-service games) have become theoretical concerns in design. While not a formal “framework,” the practice of data-driven design (telemetry loops) essentially adds a feedback layer to MDA: mechanics can be tweaked in real-time based on player data to shape dynamics and satisfaction. This is an industry “best practice” trending in studios of all sizes.
Emotional & Psychological Design: The Polaris framework for emotionally resonant mechanics ([There is No Wheel: A Framework for Creating Emotionally Resonant Game Mechanics – Polaris Game Design Retreat](https://polarisgamedesign.com/2024/there-is-no-wheel/#:~:text=At Polaris 2024%2C our group,will be a valuable tool)) is one example of a research-led approach to designing for specific feelings (e.g. dread, triumph). Additionally, designers are experimenting with biofeedback (games that respond to players’ heart rate) and narrative strategies (branching story frameworks) to enhance empathy and engagement.
Games for Impact: Serious games for health, environment, and social change are driving new theory. For instance, frameworks for “green games” combine climate education with gameplay patterns (e.g. resource management mechanics for sustainability). These purpose-driven games often reference MDA in analyses (as components and player motivations) but overlay them on larger behavior-change models.
Cross-Platform and Hybrid Experiences: With AR/VR and IoT, games increasingly span virtual and physical spaces. Design theory is adapting (e.g. mixed-reality design principles that combine board game mechanics with AR overlays). While still nascent, some researchers propose “spatial dynamics” as an extension of MDA for VR: how players move (physical mechanics) creates new dynamics and embodied aesthetics.
In the industry, high-level trend reports (GDC state-of-industry surveys, etc.) point to ethical design, diversity, and mental health as growing concerns. These often translate into internal design guidelines rather than formal academic frameworks, but they signal where theory must catch up. For example, the “Ethical Game Design” movement suggests adding new layers (e.g. ethos) alongside MDA to account for social impact, though concrete models here are still emerging.

Conclusion
In summary, game design research in 2024–2025 is both refining classic models and forging new paradigms. The MDA triad remains a touchstone – still taught and useful – but is now taught alongside its variants (DDE, DPE, RMDA) and supplemented by frameworks specific to genre or purpose (educational, cooperative, inclusive, etc.). Designers today draw on a rich toolbox: academic frameworks for analyzing system–player relationships, data-driven processes for tuning those relationships, and cutting-edge tools (AI, analytics) to extend creativity. The best practice is increasingly hybrid: use the structure of frameworks like MDA to think systematically, but adapt and expand those frameworks to fit the game’s context (be it VR, a classroom, or a board table).

Future advances will likely continue this trend: as technology and player expectations evolve, so too will design theory. Already we see AI agents influencing game mechanics, and ethics/inclusion shaping narrative dynamics. We can expect ongoing research on how to formally capture these concerns – potentially adding new “layers” or transforming the MDA model again – and industry adoption of these ideas in live projects. The result is a dynamic field where rigorous frameworks and experimental design methods co-exist to craft the games of tomorrow.
