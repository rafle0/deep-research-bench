Influence of Shoujo Manga on Queer Language in Japan
Introduction
Japanese is often described as a highly gendered language, with distinct “men’s language” (男言葉) and “women’s language” (女言葉) styles. These differences appear in personal pronouns, sentence-ending particles, and speech levels ([TW Queer Japan: Towards Gender Freedom in Japanese Language | Tokyo Weekender](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/queer-japan-gender-japanese-language/#:~:text=Stereotypically feminine and masculine styles,choice of the personal pronoun)). For example, a stereotypical feminine sentence might use watashi (私) for “I” and end with …wa (～わ), whereas a masculine equivalent might use ore (俺) and end with …ze (～ぜ) (A Queer Guide to Gendered Japanese) (A Queer Guide to Gendered Japanese).

Mass media – particularly anime and manga – are frequently cited as influences on how young people speak (). Shōjo manga (少女漫画), comics aimed primarily at young women, often feature dramatic portrayals of gender and romance. These works have sometimes used exaggerated gendered speech for character effect, a practice linguist Satoshi Kinsui terms yakuwari-go (“role language”) (). This raises the question: Does the consumption of shōjo manga influence the way queer Japanese youth use gendered language in real life? In this report, we examine academic studies, sociolinguistic surveys, and anecdotal evidence (interviews, blogs, social media) to explore how shōjo manga might shape queer youths’ use of gendered pronouns and sentence-final particles. We consider both historical trends and recent developments, highlighting correlations between media exposure and linguistic expression.

Gendered Language in Shōjo Manga
Shōjo manga’s language has evolved over the decades, often mirroring broader social changes (). Early shōjo classics from the 1950s–70s (e.g. Princess Knight or Rose of Versailles) frequently employed ultra-feminine speech for heroines (e.g. ending sentences in “…desu wa” or “…yo” with a rising tone) to signify elegance and femininity. Such “josei kotoba” (女性言葉) or “ladylike speech” was historically associated with refined women, though it was always more idealized than real ([A Queer Guide to Gendered Japanese](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/queer-japanese/#:~:text=,even most women speak Japanese)). By the 1980s and 1990s, many shōjo works began featuring gender-bending or assertive female characters who spoke in less traditionally feminine ways. For example, female delinquents or “princess knights” in shōjo manga might use blunt speech, omit polite particles, or even use typically masculine sentence-enders like ze or na to portray strength. Studies have documented that female characters in shōjo manga increasingly use fewer feminine sentence-final particles over time (). Aizawa (2003) found that the use of stereotypically feminine endings (e.g. wa, kashira) declined in girl-oriented manga, reflecting contemporary real-life speech (). Similarly, Ueno (2006) observed that young female characters in these comics sometimes use mild masculine patterns and rarely use the old-fashioned “feminine” forms ().

On the other hand, male characters in shōjo manga are often written to appeal to female readers and may speak in a softer or more polished manner than their shōnen manga counterparts. They might avoid overly crude slang and use neutral or polite speech when romancing heroines. However, they still predominantly use masculine first-person pronouns (boku or ore) in most cases (). An analysis by Unser-Schutz (2015) of ten popular manga found that pronoun usage in manga tends to follow normative gender lines – e.g. male characters mostly used ore or boku, and female characters mostly watashi or atashi – with very few exceptions () (). Interestingly, her corpus (which included shōjo series like Kimi ni Todoke and NANA) contained no instances of female characters using “boku” or “ore” to refer to themselves, contrary to the popular notion that manga girls often talk like boys () (). This suggests that mainstream shōjo manga generally don’t depict female characters outright using masculine pronouns (aside from specific transgender or cross-dressing characters). Instead, the gendered language differences appear in more subtle ways, such as female characters occasionally adopting “male” second-person pronouns (e.g. a feisty heroine saying omae “you” to friends) or using very blunt imperative forms () (). For example, in the shōjo manga NANA, the punk-rock heroine Nana Osaki calls others temee (a highly rough masculine term for “you”) even while referring to herself as atashi (an informal feminine “I”) () (). This kind of mix-and-match shows how shōjo characters can blend gendered styles to convey complex personae (tough on the outside, yet still identifying as female).

Overall, the linguistic distinctiveness of shōjo manga lies in its flexibility: these comics historically used “feminine” language as a trope, but contemporary works incorporate a range of speech styles for female characters – from gentle watashi…wa styles to more neutral or boyish tones – depending on the character’s role. The prevalence of stereotyped speech in manga has led some scholars to argue that manga primarily reflects existing language norms and changes rather than actively leading them (). In fact, one view is that manga authors (often older than their teenage readers) may lag behind youth language trends, reproducing slightly outdated styles or stereotypes (). Nonetheless, because manga is so widely read (it constitutes a large share of published media in Japan ()), any novel speech patterns it does popularize can quickly become part of youth culture. A 2007 Agency for Cultural Affairs survey found that 45% of people believed manga influenced young people’s way of speaking (), underlining the medium’s perceived impact. The question remains: how do queer youth, in particular, interpret and potentially adopt these stylized language patterns?

Queer Language Practices in Japan
Language has long been an outlet for gender and sexual minorities in Japan to express identity. Two well-documented phenomena are the use of masculine speech by queer women and feminine speech by queer men. Linguist Hideko Abe’s research on Japanese lesbian communities, for instance, found that lesbians often adopt masculine linguistic features – both as a way to reject heteronormative femininity and to assert a sense of empowerment or solidarity ([Microsoft Word - Lisa Bendall SIK230 slutversion.docx](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/handle/2077/70422/gupea_2077_70422_1.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=One characteristic of lesbian bar,The subject was not)). In conversational contexts (like in lesbian bars), women may sprinkle their speech with the rougher sentence-final particles (ze, zo, sa) and use first-person pronouns like boku or ore, which are traditionally reserved for men ([Japanese Lesbian Speech: Sexuality, Gender Identity, and Language](https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/195371?show=full#:~:text=Language repository,final particles)) ([TW Queer Japan: Towards Gender Freedom in Japanese Language | Tokyo Weekender](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/queer-japan-gender-japanese-language/#:~:text=Queer groups and their diverse,atypically feminine pronouns like atashi)). This “gender styling” serves as a subtle cue of nonconformity; by using masculine enders or pronouns, speakers index a stance that they are not typical “Japanese ladies” and perhaps signal their queer identity or tomboy persona ([Gender norms and styling in Japanese conversation: A multilevel ...](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josl.12569#:~:text=,Gay male)). It’s important to note that such usage is often context-dependent – many queer women code-switch, using more masculine forms within LGBTQ+ spaces or with queer friends and reverting to neutral/feminine forms in formal or heteronormative settings ([[PDF] Gendered Language in Japanese](https://studenttheses.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A3447241/view#:~:text=,In particular)).

Conversely, a subset of gay men in Japan are known for “onee kotoba” (オネエ言葉), literally “older-sister speech,” which is a flamboyantly feminine style of speaking. Onee kotoba is characterized by exaggerated feminine pronouns and particles – for example, using atashi (an especially girly form of “I”) instead of the masculine ore, or ending sentences with wa and no yo in an affected lilting tone ([TW Queer Japan: Towards Gender Freedom in Japanese Language | Tokyo Weekender](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/queer-japan-gender-japanese-language/#:~:text=Queer groups and their diverse,atypically feminine pronouns like atashi)) ([オネエ言葉 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/オネエ言葉#:~:text=オネエ言葉（オネエことば）とは、日本 の 61同性愛者 （ 63男性）の中の一部で話される、誇張された女性語,のことであ る。 65の一種。オネエ言葉を使う女装しないゲイをオネエと呼ぶ事がある。)). This speech style, popularized by queer TV personalities and drag queens, often includes dramatic intonation and playful slang. It has been compared to the stylized dialect of drag culture in the West ([TW Queer Japan: Towards Gender Freedom in Japanese Language | Tokyo Weekender](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/queer-japan-gender-japanese-language/#:~:text=Popularized by queer television talents%2C,line for many Japanese people)). Onee kotoba is not used by all gay men – it’s mainly an in-group code for effeminate gay men or drag performers, and many gay men distance themselves from it ([オネエ言葉 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Beyond pronouns and particles, queer speakers might also choose gender-neutral language deliberately. Some non-binary (Xジェンダー) individuals in Japan forego gendered first-person pronouns entirely, opting for their name, jibun (self), or other neutral references when possible (since Japanese allows omission of pronouns). Overall, gendered language use among queer people is fluid and strategic. As one article notes, most young Japanese today favor neutral forms, and queer youth in particular may mix forms creatively as they “find their voice” ([A Queer Guide to Gendered Japanese](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/queer-japanese/#:~:text=women speak Japanese,we agree with this perspective)) ([A Queer Guide to Gendered Japanese](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/queer-japanese/#:~:text=The Future is Nonbinary)).

Influence of Shōjo Manga on Queer Youth Speech
Shōjo manga’s impact on the speech of its readers has been a subject of debate. Many young Japanese first encounter alternative gendered speech patterns through fiction – whether it’s a princely female character saying “boku”, or an effeminate male character using “atashi”. For queer youth, who may be questioning or defying gender norms, such characters can be especially influential role models. There is evidence that some young women began using masculine first-person pronouns after seeing them in manga () (). In a survey of 136 female students, 17% admitted to having used boku or ore (male “I”) at some point, and many more had observed female peers doing so (). When asked why, respondents frequently mentioned the influence of manga and anime () (). In one anecdote from a Q&A site, a user explained that a girl they knew “uses boku because of manga’s influence” (). Another reported that girls who were avid manga readers around them tended to adopt ore/boku in speech (). These anecdotal links align with the popular perception that manga fueled the “bokukko” phenomenon (girls who refer to themselves as boku) during the 2000s ().

Importantly, not all of these girls would identify as queer – many were likely mimicking favorite characters or seeking a less formal persona. However, for queer young women (for example, those who are gender non-conforming or attracted to women), the ability to use boku or ore can carry deeper significance. It provides a linguistic tool to express a non-traditional gender identity or resist expected femininity. Psychologist Takashi Tomita noted that some girls adopt masculine pronouns out of “admiration for men or a desire not to grow up to be a conventional woman”, in addition to simple imitation of fictional characters ([ボク少女 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ボク少女#:~:text=しかし近年では、現実にそのような人称を使う女性も増えているとも言われている,はこのような傾向について、単 に男友達や、フィクション作品の一人称を真似ているうちに定着してしまった場合などが多いとしつつも、男性への憧れや、既存の女性のように成長したくないという願望の現れ である場合もあると説明している 53。)). This resonates strongly for some queer youth – a tomboy lesbian or a young trans man might first experiment with saying “Ore wa…” after seeing a beloved manga hero do the same, as a way of trying on that identity. One striking example is the actress Haruna Fuka (春名風花). She revealed that as a middle-schooler she felt the standard female “I” (watashi) was too stiff and submissive, and wished for a casual, equal-feeling pronoun. Watching the shōjo anime *Revolutionary Girl Utena*, which features a girl hero who dresses as a prince and uses boku, inspired Haruna to start calling herself boku in daily life ([ボク少女 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Shōjo and related genres (like BL – Boys’ Love manga) also expose readers to male-male romance and genderqueer characters, which can influence queer male speech. While the male protagonists in BL manga typically use male pronouns (to preserve the fantasy of two “normal” men in love), some supporting characters or comedic portrayals in shōjo media do use onee kotoba or flamboyant styles. For instance, classic shōjo series often had an “okama” (effeminate gay) character for comic relief, speaking with “~wa” and “~kashira”. A gay teen reading these might pick up on that speech pattern, either to jokingly emulate it with friends or as a formative example of queer speech. With the rise of openly queer characters in modern manga (including transgender characters in shōjo and josei works), young readers today see more varied models. A transgender female character in a shōjo manga might consistently use atashi, modeling that choice for trans femmes readers. In the manga Lovely★Complex (2001–2006), a minor trans woman character (Seiko) speaks in an exaggerated feminine manner (using atashi for “I”) (). Such portrayals, while sometimes stereotyped, nevertheless show queer youth that adopting those pronouns is an option.

Additionally, sentence-final particles (SFPs) from manga may seep into youth slang. A spunky shōjo heroine’s use of わよ (wa yo) or だもん (damon) might be mimicked playfully by readers, though often ironically. For queer youth, using an atypical particle can be a tongue-in-cheek way to flag campiness or boldness. For example, a gay teen boy in an online forum might end a sentence with “…da wa♡” to jokingly channel a manga diva – a written form of onee kotoba. On the flip side, a queer girl might adopt a brusque manga-like ending (“…jan ka!” or “…dayo ne” with a hard tone) to project toughness. These choices can be temporary “performance” of manga persona in real life, especially among fan communities. Some bloggers have described slipping into their favorite character’s voice among close friends, effectively blurring fiction and reality in their language use.

It’s worth noting that not all experts agree on the magnitude of manga’s influence. Some research suggests that manga may follow youth linguistic trends more than create them. Unser-Schutz’s analysis, for example, found no female characters using male pronouns in her sample, which challenges the assumption that girls got the idea directly from seeing it in shōjo media () (). She theorizes that authors perhaps avoid depicting such speech until it’s already somewhat normalized in real life (). In that view, queer youth’s innovative language might arise organically, with manga reflecting these changes a few years later. Even if that is the case, the perception among youth is often that media influences them – as evidenced by survey responses citing manga, and by queer individuals explicitly crediting certain characters for their speech style () ([ボク少女 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ボク少女#:~:text=当事者として「ぼく」を使用するタレントの春名風花 は、「女性が使う一人称は『わたし』だけど、ちょっと堅苦しくて、しっくりこない。……男性は時と場合に応じ て『オレ』や『ぼく』、『わたし』も使えてうらやましい。どうして女性には普通の一人称がないんだろう。女の子だって、改まるでも、こびるでもない、人と対等に話せる一人 称が欲しいのに」 90,15 ]。)). Thus, at the very least, shōjo manga provides permission and inspiration for queer youth to deviate from gendered language norms. Seeing a relatable character speak in a way that feels right can validate one’s own speech experimentation.

Media Influence and Language Usage: Notable Patterns
The table below summarizes some observed patterns and correlations between consuming shōjo media and gendered language use among Japanese youth (especially LGBTQ+ individuals):

Media Example	Language Pattern Adopted	Observed Among	Source
Shōjo manga/anime with androgynous female lead (e.g. Revolutionary Girl Utena, Sailor Uranus in Sailor Moon)	Female protagonist uses masculine first-person (boku/ore) and assertive tone. Fans imitate this in their own speech.	Young women, tomboy/queer girls who identify with the strong heroine.	- Haruna Fuka adopted boku after seeing Utena ([ボク少女 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ボク少女#:~:text=当事者として「ぼく」を使用するタレントの春名風花 は、「女性が使う一人称は『わたし』だけど、ちょっと堅苦しくて、しっくりこない。……男性は時と場合に応じ て『オレ』や『ぼく』、『わたし』も使えてうらやましい。どうして女性には普通の一人称がないんだろう。女の子だって、改まるでも、こびるでもない、人と対等に話せる一人 称が欲しいのに」 90,15 ]。)).- Psychologist: some girls use boku/ore due to fiction influence ([ボク少女 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Shōjo/BL manga portraying intimate male relationships	Gentle or neutral masculine speech (avoiding hyper-masculine roughness). Fans may prefer softer masculine styles.	Gay/bi men and BL fans, who might avoid rough slang and use boku or name instead of ore.	- Queer men often use less stereotypically “macho” speech ([TW Queer Japan: Towards Gender Freedom in Japanese Language
“Onee” characters on TV or in shōjo comics (effeminate gay archetypes)	Exaggerated feminine speech: atashi “I,” ends with wa, falsetto tone. Adopted playfully as onee kotoba.	Some gay men (esp. in entertainment or within queer circles); also used jokingly by others online.	- Onee kotoba popularized via queer TV talents ([TW Queer Japan: Towards Gender Freedom in Japanese Language
Strong female characters using masculine sentence endings (e.g. girl delinquents in manga)	Use of rough SFPs like ze, zo, or rude second-person omae/temee. Readers borrow these to sound tough or boyish.	Teen girls, especially queer or assertive ones, in casual peer speech or online persona.	- Some manga show girls using male speech elements () ().- Lesbians often use masculine SFPs to assert power ([Microsoft Word - Lisa Bendall SIK230 slutversion.docx](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/handle/2077/70422/gupea_2077_70422_1.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=One characteristic of lesbian bar,The subject was not)).
Mass media in general (manga, idol songs, anime)	Blurring of gendered language norms – e.g. female idols singing in boku, characters of one gender speaking like the other. Contributes to broader gender-neutral language trend.	Japanese youth broadly (not only queer), with queer youth at forefront of innovative usage.	- Female idol songs often use boku, creating a neutral perspective ([TW Queer Japan: Towards Gender Freedom in Japanese Language
(Table: Examples of how media content correlates with certain gendered language choices among youth.)

Trends Over Time and Generational Shifts
Historically, the interplay between media and language in Japan can be traced back many decades. As early as the 1930s, there were reports of schoolgirls using boku and kimi in real life – long before modern manga, indicating a recurring pattern of youth challenging language norms ([ボク少女 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ボク少女#:~:text=のマタ·ハリ 」としてマスコミに謳われた 65（清朝、皇族）は、婦人公論 への寄稿などでも「僕」の代名詞を使っていた。 1933（昭和8）年の7月には、,注 3 ]。)). Those early cases were often linked to rebellion or literature (e.g. girls inspired by novels or male peers). After World War II, as gender roles slowly evolved, manga became a new vehicle to imagine alternative gender expressions. In the 1970s, the Year 24 Group of shōjo manga artists introduced groundbreaking queer themes and characters: Riyoko Ikeda’s The Rose of Versailles featured Lady Oscar, a woman raised as a man who speaks with authority, and Ryoko Yamagishi’s Shiroi Heya no Futari and later shōjo works depicted lesbian romance subtleties (though language in these was still fairly polite). Representation of overtly queer characters in shōjo media was rare but present – often coded rather than explicit. Those few characters (and the artists themselves, some of whom were gender-nonconforming) planted seeds for readers.

By the 1990s and 2000s, queer themes and gender-bending characters had become more visible in mainstream shōjo. For example, Sailor Moon (a hugely popular 1990s shōjo anime/manga) included Sailor Uranus and Neptune, an openly queer female duo; Haruka (Uranus) dresses in a masculine fashion, refers to herself as ore or boku in different instances, and speaks in a casual boyish way, which undoubtedly inspired many young fans in how they might speak or view their own gender. The late ‘90s also saw the rise of boys’ love (BL) manga into mainstream bookstores, giving (mostly female) readers a space to explore masculinity and femininity outside heteronormative frameworks. Although BL is authored and read primarily by women, some gay and bi youth have also read these stories. The language of BL – often flowery, emotional, but between two male characters – perhaps gave queer male readers a script for romantic expression that wasn’t the gruff masculine norm.

In the 2010s and 2020s, Japan’s LGBTQ+ community has become more visible, and media has correspondingly diversified. We now have popular manga and anime with transgender protagonists (e.g. Hourou Musuko, though that is seinen, not shōjo), nonbinary characters, and more realistic gay/lesbian characters. These portrayals tend to avoid caricature and show more natural speech styles, which may help queer youth feel they can simply speak as themselves. At the same time, the campy onee stereotype remains a fixture on variety TV and in some comics, meaning each generation of queer men is well aware of that mode of speech and may decide to either embrace it humorously or reject it. The net effect over decades has been an expansion of the linguistic repertoire available to young people of all genders. What was once scandalous (a woman saying ore) is now almost mainstream among certain subcultures ([ボク少女 - Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ボク少女#:~:text=しかし近年では、現実にそのような人称を使う女性も増えているとも言われている,はこのような傾向について、単 に男友達や、フィクション作品の一人称を真似ているうちに定着してしまった場合などが多いとしつつも、男性への憧れや、既存の女性のように成長したくないという願望の現れ である場合もあると説明している 53。)). And what was once a strict binary in language has been loosened – with even straight youth increasingly choosing neutral forms. In many ways, queer youth have led the charge in this shift by boldly adopting speech that “doesn’t match” their assigned gender, often bolstered by seeing their experience reflected in media.

Conclusion
Shōjo manga and related media have played a significant role in shaping discussions of gender and language in Japan. While not the sole cause of any linguistic trend, they act as a mirror and a mold: reflecting ongoing changes in how gender is expressed in Japanese, while also providing new molds (characters, catchphrases, pronoun options) that young people may emulate. Within the queer community, these influences are especially salient. A transgender teen or a lesbian schoolgirl might find in manga a vocabulary for their identity – the courage to say boku or the fun of ending a sentence with wa – that helps them craft an authentic way of speaking. Academic studies confirm that queer individuals strategically use gendered language (or deliberately neutral language) to express themselves ([Microsoft Word - Lisa Bendall SIK230 slutversion.docx](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/handle/2077/70422/gupea_2077_70422_1.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=One characteristic of lesbian bar,The subject was not)) ([TW Queer Japan: Towards Gender Freedom in Japanese Language | Tokyo Weekender](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/queer-japan-gender-japanese-language/#:~:text=Queer groups and their diverse,atypically feminine pronouns like atashi)), and anecdotal evidence often traces those choices back to beloved stories and characters. Over the past few decades, as representation of diverse genders and sexualities in media has grown, queer youth have gained ever more linguistic freedom. The distinct patterns of gendered speech in shōjo manga – from princessly feminine to boyishly masculine – offer a palette of styles that young people experiment with in real life. In short, shōjo manga’s influence on language is real but nuanced: it doesn’t overwrite society’s rules overnight, but it encourages imaginative transgression, letting queer youth hear and then speak a language of their own. Through a mix of academic insight and personal voices, we see that the dialogue between media and lived experience continues to evolve, one pronoun and particle at a time.
