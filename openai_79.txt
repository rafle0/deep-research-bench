Transgender Themes in Middle Eastern and North African Cinema
Introduction
Transgender narratives in Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) cinema offer a fascinating intersection of cultural specificity and universal questions of gender identity. Historically, representations of LGBTQ+ characters in the region’s films have been present only in coded or covert forms ([Queer Representation in Arab and Middle Eastern Films: A Case Study of Women in Caramel (2007), Circumstance (2011), and In Between (2016)](https://www.alphavillejournal.com/Issue20/HTML/ArticleKarim.html#:~:text=,Bar Bahar)), due to prevailing religious, political, and social conservatism. Filmmakers who broach topics of gender and sexual nonconformity risk censorship or worse ([Queer Representation in Arab and Middle Eastern Films: A Case Study of Women in Caramel (2007), Circumstance (2011), and In Between (2016)](https://www.alphavillejournal.com/Issue20/HTML/ArticleKarim.html#:~:text=or

Historical and Cultural Context of Gender in MENA Cinema
Portrayals of gender variance in MENA cinema must be understood against a backdrop of cultural attitudes and censorship regimes. Most MENA countries have traditionally enforced strict gender norms underpinned by religious and social mores. Until recently, explicitly queer or transgender characters were virtually absent from mainstream media, or else heavily coded. For example, in Egyptian and Arab cinema of the mid-20th century, queer characters appeared only indirectly or as caricatures ([Arab Queer Cinema Emerges to Break Taboos | Middle East Institute](https://www.mei.edu/publications/arab-queer-cinema-emerges-break-taboos#:~:text=As the oldest film industry,psychologically deranged%2C or westernized liberals)). The oldest regional film industry, Egypt’s, included a few veiled references to homosexuality as early as the 1950s, but these characters were usually depicted as predatory, deranged, or “westernized” stereotypes to appease censors ([Arab Queer Cinema Emerges to Break Taboos | Middle East Institute](https://www.mei.edu/publications/arab-queer-cinema-emerges-break-taboos#:~:text=As

Despite these constraints, history shows that transgender individuals have long been part of the cultural landscape. By the late 20th century, a few trailblazing figures emerged in popular culture. In Egypt, Hanan El Tawil became the first openly trans Arab woman to perform in film, television, and theater ([The digital archive unearthing queer Arab history and popular… | Huck](https://www.huckmag.com/article/the-digital-archive-unearthing-queer-arab-history#:~:text=Hanan El Tawil portraying the,in movies%2C television and theatre)). Active from 1999 until her untimely death in 2004, El Tawil was a comedic actress whose mere presence on screen was groundbreaking in a society where transgender topics were seldom discussed. Elsewhere, in Turkey, famous singer Bülent Ersoy underwent gender affirmation surgery in the 1980s and controversially continued a highly successful entertainment career, even starring as herself in a 1981 film that dramatized her gender transition ([Coup de Genre: The Trials and Tribulations of Bülent Ersoy; Berlin 11 May 2012](https://criticallegalthinking.com/2012/03/23/coup-de-genre-the-trials-and-tribulations-of-bulent-ersoy/#:~:text=outrageous Turkish transgender singer%2Ffilm star%2C,a unique perspective on the)). Ersoy’s public trials and triumphs challenged legal and social norms in Turkey, highlighting how a transgender persona could destabilize traditional narratives and even state policies ([Coup de Genre: The Trials and Tribulations of Bülent Ersoy; Berlin 11 May 2012](https://criticallegalthinking.com/2012/03/23/coup-de-genre-the-trials-and-tribulations-of-bulent-ersoy/#:~:text=outrageous

The cultural context varies across the MENA region. In some countries, transgender individuals have found a paradoxical form of state recognition. Notably, Iran stands out for its legal distinction between homosexuality (strictly forbidden) and transsexuality (medically and religiously sanctioned in certain cases). In 1987, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa permitting sex reassignment surgeries as a cure for “diagnosed transsexuals,” even though same-sex relations remain illegal and punishable by harsh penalties ([Be Like Others - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others#:~:text=Although homosexual relationships are illegal,Others shows the experiences of)). This resulted in Iran becoming a country with one of the highest rates of gender confirmation surgeries in the world ([Be Like Others - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others#:~:text=Although

Meanwhile, the Arab countries of the Levant and North Africa have generally offered even less official accommodation for trans people. Lebanon, often considered one of the more socially liberal Arab states, saw an early portrayal of a transgender person in the documentary Cinema Fouad (1994). Co-directed by Mohammad Soueid and Tele Liban, this film follows a young trans woman, Khaled El Kurdi, from life as a military conscript to performing as a cabaret dancer to finance her gender-affirming surgery ([ Cinema Fouad – Third World Newsreel ](https://film.twn.org/products/cinema-fouad#:~:text=A documentary on the life,compelling portrait of its subject)). That Cinema Fouad was shot in Beirut and even involved a state television entity is remarkable; it weaves a complex, multilayered portrait of sexuality and identity in a Lebanese context ([ Cinema Fouad – Third World Newsreel ](https://film.twn.org/products/cinema-fouad#:~:text=A

Yet, cinema has also been a means of solace and resistance for queer and trans Arabs. As queer Moroccan writer Abdellah Taïa recounts, classic Egyptian films offered him coded visions of queerness that “saved me as a queer Arab growing up” by providing glimpses of difference within a patriarchal culture ([LGBTQ+ Films in MENA Region](https://fanack.com/culture/lgbtq-films-in-the-mena/#:~:text=“Egyptian movies saved me as,my environment%2C” Taïa told Fanack)) ([LGBTQ+ Films in MENA Region](https://fanack.com/culture/lgbtq-films-in-the-mena/#:~:text=

In summary, transgender themes in MENA cinema arise from a context of constraint but also creativity. They build on a history of coded representation and isolated precedents, and they unfold in societies where gender variance is frequently policed by law, religion, and custom. In the following sections, we will explore how particular films from Iran, the Arab world, and Turkey navigate this context. Each film (or set of films) not only tells a story about trans experiences but also engages – implicitly or explicitly – with theoretical questions of gender performativity, the politics of looking, and the power of storytelling to challenge reality.

Theoretical Frameworks: Transgender and Film Theory
Before delving into the films, it is useful to outline the theoretical lenses that inform our analysis. Judith Butler’s concept of gender performativity provides a foundational understanding of how gender is represented in these narratives. Butler argues that “gender is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of acts” ([Judith Butler Quote: “Gender is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of...”](https://quotefancy.com/quote/1116187/Judith-Butler-Gender-is-an-identity-tenuously-constituted-in-time-instituted-in-an#:~:text=“Gender is an identity tenuously,”)). In other words, gender is not a fixed essence but an ongoing performance – a set of behaviors and roles continuously citationally reproduced. This idea is highly relevant to films involving cross-dressing or gender transition. When a character in an Iranian film disguises herself as a man, or when a trans woman in a documentary rehearses feminine gestures, these scenarios illustrate Butler’s thesis that gender’s reality is created through repeated acting. We will see Butler’s insight at play especially in the Iranian context, where cinematic narratives often hinge on the performative fluidity of gender roles.

Transgender studies scholar Susan Stryker adds another crucial perspective, especially on the issue of truth and deception in trans representation. Stryker notes that society often assumes transgender people are “mak[ing] a false representation of an underlying material truth, through the wilful distortion of surface appearance”, such that their gender presentation is seen as a “lie rather than as an expression of a deep, essential truth” ([Trans Cinema and its Exit Scapes: A Transfeminist Reading of Utopian Sensibility and Gender Dissidence in Contemporary Film](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:742465/FULLTEXT02.pdf#:~:text=Tomboy 2011),about gender onto the body)). This observation will help us examine how MENA films handle the trope of “passing” and revelation. Are trans characters depicted as deceivers, or as authentic selves? For instance, when a trans character’s biological sex is revealed in a film, the narrative and camera may treat this as a moment of unmasking a “false” front – a dynamic Stryker warns against. Recognizing this bias is important in analyzing whether a film reinforces or undermines the notion that only assigned-at-birth gender is “true.” Stryker’s emphasis on self-definition and the right to one’s gender truth will guide our critique of the films’ ideological positions.

From the side of film theory, Laura Mulvey’s work on the cinematic gaze offers a tool to interrogate how trans bodies are visually treated. Mulvey’s concept of the “male gaze” in classical cinema posits that women on film are often objectified for a presumed heterosexual male viewer’s pleasure. In the context of trans representation, we might ask: Does the camera objectify trans characters or grant them subjectivity? Are trans women filmed as mere spectacles or as agents of the narrative? We will consider whether these MENA films perpetuate an objectifying gaze or subvert it. In some global films featuring trans characters (e.g. The Crying Game or Transamerica), there is a notorious tendency to include “naked-body shots” that expose the trans character’s anatomy, framing their bodies as sites of truth or shock ([Trans Cinema and its Exit Scapes: A Transfeminist Reading of Utopian Sensibility and Gender Dissidence in Contemporary Film](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:742465/FULLTEXT02.pdf#:~:text=as existing without larger support,2005)) ([Trans Cinema and its Exit Scapes: A Transfeminist Reading of Utopian Sensibility and Gender Dissidence in Contemporary Film](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:742465/FULLTEXT02.pdf#:~:text=These “naked,about gender onto the body)). Such techniques, as Stryker and others note, can sensationalize and reduce trans embodiment to biology ([Trans Cinema and its Exit Scapes: A Transfeminist Reading of Utopian Sensibility and Gender Dissidence in Contemporary Film](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:742465/FULLTEXT02.pdf#:~:text=Tomboy 2011),about gender onto the body)). Monitoring if and how MENA filmmakers avoid or engage in these visual tropes will be part of our analysis.

Jack Halberstam provides a more specialized framework with the idea of a “transgender gaze.” Halberstam argues that films can invite audiences to see through a trans character’s perspective rather than merely looking at them. In a seminal analysis of Boys Don’t Cry, Halberstam identified an “embedded” transgender gaze, wherein viewers are aligned with the protagonist’s point of view ([Trans Cinema and its Exit Scapes: A Transfeminist Reading of Utopian Sensibility and Gender Dissidence in Contemporary Film](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:742465/FULLTEXT02.pdf#:~:text=Cinema in the book In,Halberstam 2001)). Halberstam further delineates modes like the “rewind gaze” (a narrative structure where a character passes as cisgender until a revelatory climax forces the audience to retrospectively reinterpret earlier scenes) and “ghosting” (where a trans character’s presence persists after death, such as via voice-over), as well as “doubling” (where more than one gender-nonconforming character exists in the story, countering the isolation of the lone trans figure) ([Trans Cinema and its Exit Scapes: A Transfeminist Reading of Utopian Sensibility and Gender Dissidence in Contemporary Film](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:742465/FULLTEXT02.pdf#:~:text=in a Screen article%2C Halberstam,is integrated into the film)) (Trans Cinema and its Exit Scapes: A Transfeminist Reading of Utopian Sensibility and Gender Dissidence in Contemporary Film,Halberstam 2005%3A 78)). These concepts will help us articulate how MENA films structure the audience’s identification. For example, do Iranian cross-dressing dramas allow the audience to experience events through the eyes of the gender-passing character (“embedded looking”), or do they treat the character as a puzzle the audience decodes (“rewind gaze”)? The presence or absence of a transgender gaze can indicate whether a film is centering the trans experience or using it as a narrative device for others.

In dialogue with Mulvey’s and Halberstam’s gaze theory is bell hooks’ notion of the “oppositional gaze.” Hooks wrote about how Black female spectators in America learn to critically reject the ways they are misrepresented on screen, developing a rebellious way of looking that seeks to transform reality ([The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectators](https://innovativeresearchmethods.org/the-oppositional-gaze-black-female-spectators/#:~:text=This rebellious desire of looking,defiance and a site)) ([The Black Gaze - the facts of whiteness](https://thefactsofwhiteness.org/the-black-gaze/#:~:text=By courageously looking%2C we defiantly,hooks%2C 1992%2C p116)). Paraphrasing hooks: “Not only will I stare. I want my look to change reality.” ([The Black Gaze - the facts of whiteness](https://thefactsofwhiteness.org/the-black-gaze/#:~:text=The Black Gaze ,hooks%2C 1992%2C p116)). In a MENA context, we might similarly consider that queer and trans viewers adopt an oppositional gaze toward mainstream cinema that ignores or vilifies them. Moreover, when trans filmmakers (or allies) create films about transgender lives, the very act can be seen as an oppositional gaze materialized – a form of “looking back” at society and asserting one’s right to visibility. Throughout our case studies, we will note instances where filmic style or narrative stance embodies resistance to dominant norms, exemplifying what hooks described: courageously looking and thereby defying the mandate to remain invisible.

Finally, Gilles Deleuze’s ideas of becoming and minoritarian art offer a philosophical backdrop. Deleuze (often with Félix Guattari) speaks of “becoming-woman” as a process not limited to women, but as a broader metaphor for escaping fixed identity roles – a fluid transformation that destabilizes the dominant order. While we should be cautious in literalizing this concept, it resonates with the fluid gender performances seen in some MENA films. A character who shifts gender presentation or whose identity confounds expectations can be viewed as engaging in a “becoming” that challenges static categories. Additionally, Deleuze’s concept of “minor literature”, extended to minor cinema, highlights how works by marginalized groups deterritorialize language and representation from within a majority culture ([Minor cinema - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_cinema#:~:text=The term originates from French,and being truthful to its)) ([Minor cinema - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_cinema#:~:text=1,collective enunciation)). The films we discuss can be seen as minor cinema in this sense: they use the medium of national cinemas (Iranian, Turkish, Arabic) but infuse them with narratives and perspectives that are minority, subversive, and political by their very existence ([Minor cinema - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_cinema#:~:text=1

With these frameworks in mind, we turn now to the films themselves. Each case study will illustrate different facets of transgender representation in MENA cinema, analyzed with attention to narrative detail and theoretical implications.

Cross-Dressing and the “Transgender Move” in Iranian Cinema
One of the most intriguing patterns in post-1990s Iranian cinema is the prevalence of cross-dressing or gender-passing storylines. Under the strict censorship codes of the Islamic Republic, filmmakers found creative ways to depict gender transgression indirectly. In fact, as scholar Roshanak Kheshti argues, the “censorship code enforced by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance is partly responsible for the formation of what has come to be a ubiquitous figure in the New Iranian cinema: the ‘cross-dressing’ or ‘passing’ figure.” ([Cross-Dressing and Gender (Tres)Passing: The Transgender Move as a Site of Agential Potential in the New Iranian Cinema | Hypatia | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/crossdressing-and-gender-trespassing-the-transgender-move-as-a-site-of-agential-potential-in-the-new-iranian-cinema/B3633A4D5371D77758504C6CBBBF635E#:~:text=censorship code enforced by the,Dokhtaraneh Khorshid—two films that are)). By forbidding direct depiction of certain interactions between men and women, censorship unintentionally encouraged plots where a character must disguise their gender – thus creating a space for transgender and queer subtext. Kheshti identifies a “transgender move” in these films: a narrative device wherein a character temporarily crosses gender boundaries, opening a temporary space of political and agential potential for both character and audience ([Cross-Dressing and Gender (Tres)Passing: The Transgender Move as a Site of Agential Potential in the New Iranian Cinema | Hypatia | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/crossdressing-and-gender-trespassing-the-transgender-move-as-a-site-of-agential-potential-in-the-new-iranian-cinema/B3633A4D5371D77758504C6CBBBF635E#:~:text=figure—I identify a “transgender move”%3A,post 1990s New Iranian cinema)). This transgender move is fleeting by design – the disguise is usually revealed or the character returns to normative gender roles by the story’s end – yet it provides a moment in which Iranian filmmakers and viewers can explore alternative gender positions under the radar of censors ([Cross-Dressing and Gender (Tres)Passing: The Transgender Move as a Site of Agential Potential in the New Iranian Cinema | Hypatia | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/crossdressing-and-gender-trespassing-the-transgender-move-as-a-site-of-agential-potential-in-the-new-iranian-cinema/B3633A4D5371D77758504C6CBBBF635E#:~:text=figure

Two exemplary Iranian films in this subgenre are Baran (2001, dir. Majid Majidi) and Dokhtaran-e Khorshid (Daughters of the Sun, 2000, dir. Maryam Shahriar). In both, the protagonists are young women who pass as boys to survive harsh economic realities. Baran tells the story of a teenage Afghan refugee girl working at a Tehran construction site disguised as a boy (she adopts the name “Rahmat”). Her secret is eventually discovered by a male coworker, Lateef, who develops a quiet affection for her. Daughters of the Sun centers on a rural Iranian girl who is sent to work in a carpet-weaving workshop; her hair is shorn and she presents as male (“Aman”) among the all-male laborers. These films were not marketed as LGBTQ+ stories – the characters in question are not depicted as transgender in the internal logic of the narrative, but rather as girls making pragmatic decisions in a patriarchal environment. Nonetheless, the imagery and themes strongly evoke transgender experiences: the binding of breasts, the taking on of a new name, the navigation of social situations in another gender, and the constant fear of being “found out.”

From a theoretical perspective, such films vividly illustrate Butler’s notion of gender performativity. The protagonists literally perform masculinity – wearing men’s clothes, speaking in deeper tones, adopting masculine mannerisms – as a means of survival. Their successful performances underscore that the trappings of manhood can be learned and enacted. Gender here is shown to be, in Butler’s words, “a stylized repetition of acts” ([Judith Butler Quote: “Gender is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of...”](https://quotefancy.com/quote/1116187/Judith-Butler-Gender-is-an-identity-tenuously-constituted-in-time-instituted-in-an#:~:text=“Gender is an identity tenuously,”)) rather than an innate quality. At the same time, these movies employ the “rewind gaze” dynamic described by Halberstam. In Baran, for instance, the audience initially sees Rahmat as a fragile, beardless teenage boy; the reveal of Rahmat’s female identity partway through prompts viewers (and Lateef within the film) to reinterpret earlier scenes – why was “he” so silent and reserved? why did “he” avoid roughhousing? The narrative thus hinges on a retrospective understanding that what appeared to be one gender was another. This aligns with Halberstam’s description of a trans reveal functioning as a central narrative climax that forces a re-reading of the film’s images ([Trans Cinema and its Exit Scapes: A Transfeminist Reading of Utopian Sensibility and Gender Dissidence in Contemporary Film](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:742465/FULLTEXT02.pdf#:~:text=in a Screen article%2C Halberstam,is integrated into the film)). The revelation is handled with poetic subtlety in Baran (Lateef finds Rahmat’s ID card with her female photo, and sees her with hair uncovered briefly), but its impact is profound: Lateef’s behavior toward Rahmat shifts from rivalry to protectiveness and love. The film, in this way, doubles as a chaste heteronormative romance once the gender truth is known, even as it allowed a transgressive gaze beforehand.

Critically, the transgender move in these Iranian films tends to be temporary and non-identitarian. By the conclusions, the status quo is usually restored. In Baran, the girl Baran must leave the construction site (and Iran) with her father; Lateef is left with only a token (her dropped shoe) as a memory, and no permanent change to the gender order occurs – Baran reverts to living as a woman, and their tender almost-romance remains unconsummated. Daughters of the Sun has a bleaker ending (spoiler: the protagonist’s female identity is violently exposed), underscoring the danger of her transgression. Thus, while these films create a pocket of “agential potential” when the heroines exercise the agency to “become” male for a while ([Cross-Dressing and Gender (Tres)Passing: The Transgender Move as a Site of Agential Potential in the New Iranian Cinema | Hypatia | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/crossdressing-and-gender-trespassing-the-transgender-move-as-a-site-of-agential-potential-in-the-new-iranian-cinema/B3633A4D5371D77758504C6CBBBF635E#:~:text=figure—I identify a “transgender move”%3A,post 1990s New Iranian cinema)), they ultimately stop short of an enduring challenge to Iran’s gender norms. The temporary nature of the disguise could be interpreted as reinforcing the notion that the traditional gender binary must resume. Yet, Iranian audiences – both domestic and diasporic – have found significant meaning in these narratives ([Cross-Dressing and Gender (Tres)Passing: The Transgender Move as a Site of Agential Potential in the New Iranian Cinema | Hypatia | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/crossdressing-and-gender-trespassing-the-transgender-move-as-a-site-of-agential-potential-in-the-new-iranian-cinema/B3633A4D5371D77758504C6CBBBF635E#:~:text=figure

It is worth noting how these Iranian films toe a line with authorities: because the cross-dressing is contextualized by necessity and not framed as a true gender identity, the films skirt accusations of promoting deviance. In line with Stryker’s observation, the narrative implies the characters are not truly transgender – they are pretending (in the eyes of other characters) – which may comfort conservative viewers who see the passing as a plot device rather than a valid identity. However, more critical viewers could read against the grain and see the humanity and courage in these protagonists as a subtle advocacy for gender freedom. The very empathy elicited for Rahmat/Aman can be a politicizing force, prompting viewers to question why society makes it so hard for someone assigned female to enjoy the privileges of being male.

By the late 2000s, Iranian cinema produced a film that broke new ground by portraying a transgender character not as a passing disguise but as their authentic self. This film is Facing Mirrors (Aynehaye Rooberoo, 2011), directed by Negar Azarbayjani. Facing Mirrors is notable as the first Iranian narrative feature with a transgender protagonist ([Facing Mirrors - Frameline](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors#:~:text=Facing Mirrors ,film with a transgender protagonist)) ([Facing Mirrors](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors#:~:text=Iranian narrative film with a,off to a male cousin)). It tells the story of Adineh, who goes by the nickname “Eddie,” a transgender man (assigned female at birth) from a wealthy Iranian family. Eddie is desperate to escape Iran in order to undergo female-to-male sex reassignment surgery abroad – ironically, not because Iran lacks the medical infrastructure (sex reassignment is, as the film points out, surprisingly accessible in Iran ([Facing Mirrors](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors#:~:text=Iranian

Facing Mirrors allows for a nuanced exploration of local understandings of gender identity. When Rana first learns that her passenger, whom she assumed to be a young man, is in fact “trans,” she is shocked to the point of panic, resulting in a minor car accident ([Facing Mirrors](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors#:~:text=down a passing car,between Rana and Eddie achieves)) ([Facing Mirrors](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors#:~:text=Eddie tries to explain that,their class and ethical differences)). Rana embodies the traditional view: to her, Eddie’s situation is almost unthinkable and certainly “against all she believes in and traditions she values” ([Facing Mirrors - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facing_Mirrors#:~:text=Adineh is transgender%2C and is,4)). Yet, as circumstances force them to travel together and evade Eddie’s pursuers, an unlikely friendship forms. The film’s narrative deftly uses the contrast between a conservative, religious woman and a trans man from an upper-class background to examine prejudice and empathy. Initially, Rana’s instinct is to reject what Eddie is – at one point she exclaims that she cannot comprehend how someone would choose to “change God’s creation.” But gradually, Rana comes to see Eddie’s humanity and the sincerity of his identity. They bond over shared experiences of oppression: Rana as a woman facing economic hardship and societal scorn for working a “man’s job,” Eddie as a trans man facing familial coercion and public harassment. Their “newfound independence” from patriarchal control (Rana’s from her absent husband’s dictates, Eddie’s from his father’s) becomes the basis of mutual understanding ([Facing Mirrors - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facing_Mirrors#:~:text=Adineh

In terms of cinematic form, Facing Mirrors shifts the Iranian portrayal of trans individuals from subtext to text. Eddie is not a metaphor or a disguise; he openly articulates his identity. The script includes moments of education, as when Eddie patiently explains to Rana what it means to be transgender (in the local vernacular, he might use the term “transsexual” as that is more common in Iran post-Khomeini’s fatwa). This kind of explicit dialogue would have been unthinkable in an earlier era. If Baran invited the audience to sympathize with a cross-dressed girl without ever using the word “transgender,” Facing Mirrors is determined to speak the word aloud and normalize it. The film was made independently and screened at international festivals (such as Frameline in San Francisco), garnering praise for its compassionate storytelling and the “magnetic, heartbreaking performance” of actress Shayesteh Irani as Eddie ([Facing Mirrors](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors#:~:text=Eddie tries to explain that,their class and ethical differences)). (Interestingly, Shayesteh Irani had previously appeared in Jafar Panahi’s Offside (2006) – another Iranian film about women passing as men, in that case to attend a soccer match. This bit of casting links Facing Mirrors back to the cross-dressing trope, but now in service of a fully realized trans character.)

Analyzing Facing Mirrors through Halberstam’s concept of the transgender gaze, we can see that the film does offer moments of “embedded” transgender perspective. We often follow Eddie’s point of view, feeling his anxiety and determination. Notably, the film refrains from any prurient “genital reveal” or physical exposé; Eddie’s trans status is established through dialogue and context, not through a voyeuristic camera shot. In this way, Azarbayjani avoids the objectifying tactics common in Western “trans reveal” scenes ([Trans Cinema and its Exit Scapes: A Transfeminist Reading of Utopian Sensibility and Gender Dissidence in Contemporary Film](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:742465/FULLTEXT02.pdf#:~:text=These “naked,about gender onto the body)), focusing instead on Eddie’s face, voice, and emotions to convey his identity. Facing Mirrors challenges the Iranian social norm by asserting Eddie’s existence as a truth – aligning with Stryker’s insistence that trans identity is an expression of deep truth, not deception ([Trans Cinema and its Exit Scapes: A Transfeminist Reading of Utopian Sensibility and Gender Dissidence in Contemporary Film](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:742465/FULLTEXT02.pdf#:~:text=Tomboy 2011),about gender onto the body)). While the film stops short of showing Eddie after transition (the story ends before he reaches Germany for surgery), it strongly implies that his course is just and necessary, and that Rana’s acceptance is the model for society at large.

In summary, Iranian cinema’s engagement with transgender themes has evolved from allegorical “passing” plots to more direct transgender storytelling. Early cross-dressing narratives like Baran and Daughters of the Sun used gender disguise as a creative solution to censorship and as a commentary on gender inequality, offering a temporary transgender “move” that viewers found liberating ([Cross-Dressing and Gender (Tres)Passing: The Transgender Move as a Site of Agential Potential in the New Iranian Cinema | Hypatia | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/crossdressing-and-gender-trespassing-the-transgender-move-as-a-site-of-agential-potential-in-the-new-iranian-cinema/B3633A4D5371D77758504C6CBBBF635E#:~:text=figure—I identify a “transgender move”%3A,post 1990s New Iranian cinema)). These films, while not explicitly about transgender identity, laid groundwork by familiarizing audiences with the idea that gender could be assumed and performed – reinforcing Butler’s point that the coherence of genders can be disturbed and reconstituted through performance ([Judith Butler Quote: “Gender is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of...”](https://quotefancy.com/quote/1116187/Judith-Butler-Gender-is-an-identity-tenuously-constituted-in-time-instituted-in-an#:~:text=“Gender is an identity tenuously,”)). Building on that, Facing Mirrors represented a breakthrough: it shifted the discourse from performing another gender to being oneself in spite of assigned gender, pushing the envelope on Iranian screens. Together, these films both leverage and loosen the constraints of Iran’s cultural context. They demonstrate how savvy filmmakers use implication and allegory when necessary, and turn to open representation when possible, to broaden the conversation about gender identity. Iranian trans narratives, therefore, have been at once a product of restrictive circumstances and a quiet rebellion against them.

Documentary Realities: Trans Lives in the Middle East and North Africa
Fictional narratives provide one avenue for exploring transgender themes, but documentary films offer another powerful mode – one rooted in real-life stories and testimony. In the MENA region, several documentaries have bravely spotlighted the experiences of transgender individuals, often in the face of societal silence or hostility. These documentaries not only serve as historical records of trans lives but also engage issues of visibility, authenticity, and the clash between personal identity and social norms. We will examine two in detail: Be Like Others (2008, Iran) and The Belle from Gaza (2024, Palestine/Israel), while also referencing earlier works like Cinema Fouad (1994, Lebanon) as context.

Be Like Others (Iran, 2008) – Curing or Being Oneself?
Be Like Others, directed by Tanaz Eshaghian, is a critically acclaimed documentary that aired on HBO under the title Transsexual in Iran. Filmed in Tehran, it profiles several young Iranian trans women (assigned male at birth) as they undergo or consider sex reassignment surgery. The film’s title encapsulates the central irony it examines: in Iran, being transgender is tacitly encouraged by the authorities, but often only as a means to “be like others” – that is, to conform to heteronormativity – rather than to be one’s true self. As discussed earlier, Iran permits and even partially subsidizes gender-confirmation surgeries, treating them as a medical cure. Be Like Others lays bare the human dimension of this policy. Its participants, such as a woman named Negar and another named Anousheh, recount how they felt different from early on and eventually sought medical transition. However, many of them also voice a poignant awareness that Iranian society would never accept them as gay men who loved men – they felt compelled to transition in order to survive or find some acceptance ([Be Like Others - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others#:~:text=they are not homosexual%2C seeing,to live free from harassment)). One cleric in the film openly says that these individuals “are not homosexual” – implying that by transitioning, they avoid the sinful status of homosexuality ([Be Like Others - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others#:~:text=they

The documentary’s style is intimate and unflinching. It shows patients in clinical settings, consulting with doctors and even undergoing surgery, but it equally focuses on their emotional lives – their interactions with family, their hopes for love, their fears about the future. By allowing trans Iranians to speak for themselves, Be Like Others combats the stereotype (noted by Stryker) that they are deceivers living a “lie.” On the contrary, we see the sincerity of their convictions. One subject tearfully describes praying for God to either “fix” them or let them die if they could not transition – highlighting that, for them, living in the wrong gender role was an unbearable falsehood. This flips the script on who is being false: the problem is not that trans people are lying about who they are; it’s that society lied to them by insisting they must be a certain way.

Yet, Be Like Others also raises uncomfortable questions about authenticity. Are all the subjects truly transgender in a personal sense, or are some pushed into it by circumstance? The film doesn’t shy away from this ambiguity. For example, we meet a young man who is gay and not trans, but who is contemplating surgery because he sees no other way to be with a male partner in Iran – a harrowing predicament. This blurring of lines troubles any neat category of identity. Eshaghian treats her subjects empathetically, suggesting that whatever their mix of motivations, their pain is real and valid. The title itself hints at the pressure to conform: these individuals undergo drastic transformations partly so they can “be like others” (heterosexual norms), but in doing so they are also trying to be themselves. The film invites the audience to question: What does authenticity mean in such a coercive context? Is authenticity the internal sense of self, or the socially recognized role? For Negar and others, aligning their bodies with their inner sense of womanhood is authentic – even if the initial catalyst was societal pressure, the end result is a genuine personal fulfillment.

In terms of visibility, Be Like Others had a significant impact internationally. It premiered at Sundance and won awards, bringing to light a reality that few outside Iran knew – that Iran was paradoxically a haven for trans surgery. Within Iran, however, the film was not officially distributed (it would likely have been deemed too controversial for its candid portrayal of nightlife and relationships among trans women). Nevertheless, by existing, it punctured a hole in the wall of silence. It put faces and stories to a phenomenon often only discussed in Iran in abstract or moralizing terms.

From a film theory perspective, one might say Be Like Others constructs an oppositional gaze (in hooks’ sense) against the Iranian state’s gaze. The regime might see trans individuals as subjects for medical normalization; Eshaghian’s camera instead sees them as humans seeking dignity. By “staring” at them with compassion and inviting them to stare back (some scenes show the characters looking directly into camera, speaking truth to the lens), the documentary attempts to “change reality” ([The Black Gaze - the facts of whiteness](https://thefactsofwhiteness.org/the-black-gaze/#:~:text=The Black Gaze ,hooks%2C 1992%2C p116)) – to change how viewers, Iranian or Western, perceive trans people in Iran. There are scenes in which the trans women dance together or put on makeup in a safe house – moments of joy and solidarity away from prying eyes – and the film treats these moments as beautiful and normal, implicitly urging the audience to do the same. The gaze here is not exploitative but allied with its subjects.

Be Like Others also dialogues implicitly with Butler’s gender performativity. In one sequence, a cleric tells a trans woman that after her surgery she must “act like a complete woman” – dress appropriately, behave modestly, etc. The authorities want not only a body change but a performance change to match. This underscores Butler’s point: the “reality” of gender (even in a legal sense) is established through sustained performance. The trans women are effectively told to perform the role of woman to be recognized as such. The bittersweet element is that this performance is both freeing and constraining – freeing because it allows them to live as women, constraining because it must fit conservative expectations of women. The film subtly critiques this: one subject, after surgery, remarks that she still feels attracted to women (implying she might be a trans lesbian), which is something the law and society did not account for. Her very existence then challenges the simplistic binary solution of the state. Real life doesn’t slot neatly into legal gender boxes.

The Belle from Gaza (Palestine/Israel, 2024) – Identities Across Borders
Fast-forward to the 2020s, and we encounter a documentary reflecting another facet of trans experiences in the MENA: the intersection of gender identity with geopolitical conflict. The Belle from Gaza, directed by Yolande Zauberman, premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival ([‘To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?’: the women defying national and gender boundaries | Film | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/16/yolande-zauberman-documentary-the-belle-from-gaza-cannes-film-festival#:~:text=The Belle from Gaza premieres,it would never be seen)). It follows the journey of several Palestinian trans women who flee the Gaza Strip to live in Tel Aviv, Israel – a place where they can openly be themselves in a way impossible back home. The very premise – “transsexual women moving from Palestine to Tel Aviv to live out their new identities” ([‘To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?’: the women defying national and gender boundaries | Film | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/16/yolande-zauberman-documentary-the-belle-from-gaza-cannes-film-festival#:~:text=Her film was not meant,statement on the current conflict)) – is politically charged. Gaza is an isolated, war-torn enclave under Hamas rule, where homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not only taboo but can be life-threatening. Israel, in contrast, while far from utopian, has legal frameworks that allow, for instance, male-to-female gender confirmation surgery in public hospitals ([‘To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?’: the women defying national and gender boundaries | Film | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/16/yolande-zauberman-documentary-the-belle-from-gaza-cannes-film-festival#:~:text=statement on the current conflict)) and an active LGBTQ community (especially in Tel Aviv). For a Gazan trans woman, escaping to Israel is a complex act: it means crossing an enemy border and seeking refuge in a society that is in conflict with one’s own people.

Zauberman’s film reportedly approaches this sensitive story by focusing on the personal over the overtly political. She has said the film was “not meant to be a demonstration of anything”, yet she was acutely aware that “its title and synopsis alone … risked being read as a political statement” in the context of the Israel-Palestine conflict ([‘To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?’: the women defying national and gender boundaries | Film | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/16/yolande-zauberman-documentary-the-belle-from-gaza-cannes-film-festival#:~:text=finished project,big%2C so huge”%2C says Zauberman)). Indeed, the mere fact of showing Palestinian Arabs finding freedom in Israel can be interpreted in various ways. But The Belle from Gaza seems to center the trans women’s perspective: their courage, their struggles, their “surprising faith” in the possibility of a better life despite being doubly marginalized ([‘To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?’: the women defying national and gender boundaries | Film | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/16/yolande-zauberman-documentary-the-belle-from-gaza-cannes-film-festival#:~:text=Philip Oltermann in Cannes)) ([‘To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?’: the women defying national and gender boundaries | Film | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/16/yolande-zauberman-documentary-the-belle-from-gaza-cannes-film-festival#:~:text=Yolande Zauberman’s documentary The Belle,their courage and surprising faith)). The Guardian’s Cannes coverage highlights the question that hovers over the film: “To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?” ([‘To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?’: the women defying national and gender boundaries | Film | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/16/yolande-zauberman-documentary-the-belle-from-gaza-cannes-film-festival#:~:text=‘To escape Gaza is already,defying national and gender boundaries)) – underscoring the extraordinary bravery of these individuals who defy both national boundaries and gender norms.

In terms of narrative, The Belle from Gaza likely documents the women’s lives in Tel Aviv, their reflections on Gaza, and perhaps their interactions with each other and with local Israeli society. One can imagine scenes of them building a supportive community, maybe performing (the title “Belle” hints one might be a performer or beauty queen). The film also carries the weight of recent events: Zauberman finished it amid escalating violence in 2023-2024, at one point considering postponing its release due to the war outbreak in October 2023 ([‘To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?’: the women defying national and gender boundaries | Film | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/16/yolande-zauberman-documentary-the-belle-from-gaza-cannes-film-festival#:~:text=Sylvain Lefevre%2FWireImage)). Ultimately she chose to show it, buoyed by positive responses from both Arab and Jewish viewers in test screenings ([‘To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?’: the women defying national and gender boundaries | Film | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/16/yolande-zauberman-documentary-the-belle-from-gaza-cannes-film-festival#:~:text=In Israel%2C gay marriage can,territories homosexuality remains a taboo)). This detail is telling – it suggests that despite the political minefield, people from both sides found value in the film. Possibly, the humanity of the trans women bridges a divide: their story becomes a point of empathy that transcends entrenched hostilities.

From a theoretical angle, The Belle from Gaza can be seen as an example of what Deleuze and Guattari would call deterritorialization. These trans women deterritorialize gender – by rejecting the roles imposed on them in Gaza – and also literally deterritorialize themselves by crossing into a new land. They inhabit what Homi Bhabha might term a “third space” of identity: neither fully accepted in their homeland nor entirely at home in Israel, but creating a new hybrid identity in between. The camera’s gaze here has to negotiate multiple layers of otherness: these subjects are likely viewed as “other” by Israeli society (as Palestinians), and as “other” by their own society (as trans). The documentary potentially cultivates a gaze of solidarity, showing that their quest for authenticity is universal.

One can also see the oppositional gaze at work: these trans women, who were forced to hide in Gaza, now stare into the camera under the Mediterranean sun, asserting “we are here.” In one reported still from the film ([‘To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?’: the women defying national and gender boundaries | Film | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/16/yolande-zauberman-documentary-the-belle-from-gaza-cannes-film-festival#:~:text=Image%3A Not meant to be,from The Belle from Gaza)), we see an image described as “Not meant to be ‘a demonstration of anything’ … a still from The Belle from Gaza” ([‘To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?’: the women defying national and gender boundaries | Film | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/16/yolande-zauberman-documentary-the-belle-from-gaza-cannes-film-festival#:~:text=Image%3A

The film also inherently challenges dominant narratives in both societies. It challenges the Gazan (and broadly conservative Arab) narrative that transgender people either don’t exist or are deviant Western imports; here are devout or ordinary Palestinians who are trans, clearly existing and asserting their truth. Simultaneously, it might challenge Israeli audiences to see Palestinians beyond the usual frames of conflict – here, Palestinians are not only victims or adversaries, but individuals seeking freedom, paralleling the struggles of Israeli trans people or any other. In doing so, The Belle from Gaza underscores that the desire to live one’s authentic gender is a human desire that knows no borders.

While we have less detailed information on the cinematic techniques of The Belle from Gaza (being a very new film), it stands as a cutting-edge example of MENA trans cinema expanding into new territories both literal and figurative. It deals head-on with visibility: the women have decided to make themselves visible in a world that pushed them into the shadows. It deals with censorship in an implicit way: their very flight from Gaza is a result of extreme censorship of identity (Hamas would censor their existence entirely, potentially violently). And it grapples with local understandings of gender: perhaps showing how the concept of being transgender is translated across cultures – from a place where it’s unspeakable to a place where it’s at least medically understood.

Other Notable Documentaries and Voices
In addition to Be Like Others and The Belle from Gaza, other documentaries have contributed to transgender visibility in the region. We’ve mentioned Cinema Fouad (Lebanon, 1994) as an early case; its portrait of a Lebanese trans woman in the 90s remains important as a historical document. In Turkey, a documentary titled “My Child” (Benim Çocuğum) (2013) featured parents of LGBTQ individuals, including a mother of a trans man, advocating for their children – indicating growing discourse around trans acceptance in Turkish civil society. There’s also Inside Out (2013), an Iranian documentary that profiled multiple trans men and women in Iran, providing a more grassroots complement to Be Like Others.

Notably, Turkey also had “Other Angels” (Teslimiyet) (2010), which, although a narrative film, had quasi-documentary realism in depicting four transgender sex workers in Istanbul ([Other Angels - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Angels#:~:text=Other Angels ,1)). It deserves mention for bravery: Other Angels went on nationwide release in Turkey ([Other Angels - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Angels#:~:text=Other

Collectively, these documentaries and docu-dramas perform an invaluable function. They provide authentic voices – the people on screen are living the reality, not characters written by someone else. This authenticity counters the distortions and sensationalism often seen in media. Where a news channel might reduce a trans person to an object of scandal, these films let them narrate their own story. This aligns with what hooks would advocate: allowing marginalized people to craft their image and narrative, rather than being objectified by an outsider’s gaze. It also aligns with Stryker’s call for trans people to have the right of self-definition – on camera, these individuals define themselves, and the films by and large respect their self-descriptions.

In terms of challenging or reinforcing norms, the documentaries are largely on the side of challenging. They intentionally confront the viewer with real individuals who do not fit societal norms, asking the viewer to expand their understanding. However, one could argue there’s a potential pitfall if not handled carefully: audiences might exoticize or pity the subjects instead of empathizing. The best of these documentaries avoid framing trans lives as merely tragic. They incorporate moments of resilience, joy, and normalcy, which reinforce that trans people are not fundamentally different in their humanity – only in their specific circumstances of navigating a hostile environment.

Transgender Characters in Mainstream MENA Cinema: Challenging the Norms from Within
While art-house films and documentaries have been crucial in pushing representation forward, another significant development is the gradual emergence of transgender characters in more mainstream MENA cinema. This is particularly evident in Turkey and, to a lesser extent, in the Arab Middle East in very recent years. Mainstream films are important because they reach wider audiences and can indicate a shift in public tolerance or interest. Here, we will focus on a groundbreaking Turkish example and then comment on the status in Arab cinema.

Aile Arasında (Turkey, 2017) – A Family Comedy with a Trans Twist
In 2017, a Turkish comedy film titled Aile Arasında (“Among Family”), directed by Ozan Açıktan, became a massive hit, selling millions of tickets in Turkey’s cinemas. Amid the film’s ensemble of humorous characters was Behiye, a middle-aged woman who is openly transgender. Behiye is played by Ayta Sözeri, a well-known Turkish trans actress and singer. Not only is Ayta Sözeri’s casting notable (a transgender actress playing a transgender character, ensuring authenticity in representation ([[PDF] Being Queer in Turkish Cinema: Existence, Appearance, and ...](https://cinej.pitt.edu/ojs/cinej/article/view/603/745#:~:text=,with the same gender identity))), but the character herself is treated with warmth and respect unusual for trans depictions in much of Middle Eastern media. Reviewers praised the film for featuring an “openly trans character” and noted that its “jokes are funny without being offensive” ([‎In the Family (2017) directed by Ozan Açıktan • Reviews, film + cast • Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/film/in-the-family-2017/#:~:text=turkish cinema%3A aile arasinda%3A ,absolute goddesses on the stage)). Indeed, Aile Arasında managed to derive comedy from family and relationship situations without resorting to cruel mockery of Behiye’s gender. This is a significant step; it suggests that Turkish popular culture was ready to include a trans character as a source of humor and heart, not as a freak or villain.

In the film’s plot, Behiye Hala (hala meaning “aunt”) is the best friend of the female lead, Solmaz. The story involves a tangle of domestic antics when Solmaz’s daughter gets engaged to a young man from a very conservative family, and Solmaz enlists a neurotic friend to pose as her husband for the wedding preparations. Behiye, as Solmaz’s confidante, becomes part of the ad-hoc “family” that must convince the groom’s parents of their normalcy. Much of the comedy comes from culture clashes and cover-ups of various personal secrets. Crucially, Behiye’s transgender identity is known to Solmaz’s friends and is not the subject of ridicule among them – she’s simply Aunt Behiye, a beloved member of the gang. However, there are comic moments arising from interactions with the conservative in-laws who are unaware of Behiye’s background. The humor in those scenes tends to stem from Behiye cleverly navigating nosy or intrusive questions, or the others shielding her from potential discovery. Unlike older films that might use this scenario for cruel exposure or panic, Aile Arasında treats Behiye’s identity with dignity; the joke is more often at the expense of the narrow-minded who might be scandalized, rather than at Behiye herself. In other words, the film invites the audience to be complicit with Behiye and her friends, laughing at the prejudice and absurdity of bigots, not at the existence of a trans woman.

From a theoretical standpoint, Aile Arasında is interesting because it places a trans character in the heart of a conventional genre (the family/farce comedy) and normalizes her. The film can be seen as practicing a gentle form of hooks’ oppositional gaze within a mainstream framework – it presents Behiye through a loving gaze that contrasts with how Turkish media might usually stereotypically portray trans women (often as either sex workers or tragic figures). The character of Behiye is a middle-class, maternal figure (she is nicknamed “aunt” by everyone). This challenges the dominant image in Turkey, where transgender women (often called “travesti” or “transseksüel” in Turkish) are frequently marginalized. By integrating Behiye as just another member of the community, the film quietly asserts that trans women can be respected figures in society. In effect, it positions the audience to identify with Behiye and root for her, using the classic tools of comedy and sentiment.

Ayta Sözeri’s casting also carries meta-textual weight. Sözeri is celebrated as Turkey’s first trans actress to achieve such prominence ([LGBT+ History Month: Five Turkish icons to celebrate - T-VINE](https://www.t-vine.com/lgbt-history-month-five-turkish-icons-to-celebrate/#:~:text=T,to Izmir with her)), and her performance earned her a Best Supporting Actress award, signaling industry recognition of her talent regardless of gender identity ([Turkish Transsexual Actress Wins Best Supporting Female Actress ...](https://turkishgaynews.quora.com/Turkish-Transsexual-Actress-Wins-Best-Supporting-Female-Actress-Award#:~:text=,million people the movie)). The filmmakers “addressed the issue of representation by allowing a transgender performer to play a character with the same gender identity” ([[PDF] Being Queer in Turkish Cinema: Existence, Appearance, and ...](https://cinej.pitt.edu/ojs/cinej/article/view/603/745#:~:text=,with the same gender identity)) – a move that not only improved the authenticity of the portrayal but also was a statement in itself in a country where LGBT issues have become more politically fraught in recent years. During the 2010s, Turkey saw both advances (like popular TV shows featuring gay characters, and the growth of Istanbul’s Pride parade) and setbacks (the banning of Pride after 2015, rising transphobic rhetoric from some officials). Aile Arasında arrived at a moment where Turkish society was in flux regarding these issues. The film’s huge success (it was one of the top grossing Turkish films of that year) suggests that audiences largely embraced its inclusive message, or at least were not deterred by it.

Visually and narratively, Aile Arasında doesn’t treat Behiye with any special lens – and that is precisely its quietly radical approach. There is no dramatic, Mulveyan male gaze objectification at play; Behiye is not sexualized in the narrative (she is actually portrayed as single and a bit romantically lonely, in a sympathetic way). Nor is there a “transgender reveal” shock moment – it’s understood from early on by the audience that she’s trans (for those who didn’t know Ayta Sözeri already, there are small hints, but the film doesn’t make a big plot point of revealing it). This avoids the usual voyeuristic or deceptive framing entirely. In Halberstam’s terms, we might say the film foregoes the “rewind gaze” or any need for an exposé because it never hides Behiye’s identity from the viewer – it only hides it from certain other characters for situational comedy. This means the audience is aligned with Behiye and her inner circle (we share their knowledge), which is a form of embedded gaze. We see events from their perspective of trying to manage prejudice, rather than from an outsider’s perspective gawking at Behiye. Such an alignment is a notable shift for a mainstream comedy. It invites cisgender audiences to empathize with the circumstances trans people often face – the stress of whether to disclose or hide, the pain when someone might not accept them – but in a way leavened by humor and humanism.

The ideological implication of Aile Arasında is largely challenging to dominant norms, but in a soft, accessible manner. It challenges the idea that trans people cannot be part of “normal” society or family. In the world of the film, Behiye is family. It challenges the notion that trans characters must be defined by tragedy; here, the worst that happens is some comedic embarrassment, and the best that happens is she is loved and included. However, one could argue there is still an element of reinforcing norms in that Behiye must “pass” to Solmaz’s in-laws to avoid conflict – implying that society at large still expects trans women to remain invisible or indistinguishable from cis women to be tolerated. The film navigates this carefully: it doesn’t depict any comeuppance or big “coming out” victorious moment for Behiye; rather, the resolution sidesteps confrontation (focusing instead on the other plotlines resolving happily). This could be seen as a pragmatic choice – in real life, not every situation ends with a grand acceptance scene – but it also means the film stops just short of showing a conservative character explicitly accepting a trans woman. In that sense, the dominant norm (trans status must remain private in certain circles) is left tactically unchallenged within the story. The victory is more implicit: the film itself, by existence, has normalized Behiye to the audience. The audience’s acceptance is the real triumph, even if not all in-universe characters are confronted.

Arab Mainstream Cinema and Transgender Themes
What about mainstream cinema in the Arab Middle East and North Africa? Here, progress has been slower and more tentative. To date, there have been few if any major Arabic-language commercial films with an explicitly transgender main character. This is largely due to stricter censorship and societal attitudes in Arab countries, where even gay and lesbian characters only recently started to appear in independent films (and almost never in big-budget ones). However, some signs of change exist. For instance, the Egyptian independent film All My Life (2008) by Maher Sabry, while focused on gay men, included a sympathetic portrayal of a drag queen (who could be seen as gender-nonconforming if not explicitly trans). And in 2021, an Egyptian film Souad subtly touched on issues of gender expression and online identity (one subplot involves an adolescent who adopts a secret online persona that defies her conservative environment, hinting at the fluidity of identity in the digital age). These are baby steps compared to what we’ve seen in Iran or Turkey.

One high-profile trans figure in the Arab world recently is the Moroccan belly dancer Noor, who came out as a trans woman and has gained media attention. While not a film character, her public presence has sparked conversations in North Africa about trans identities. It is likely only a matter of time before her story or similar ones find their way into Arab cinema, perhaps in documentary form or as inspiration for fictional characters. The Lebanese filmmaker and actor Mazen Khaled has included trans women performers in some of his short films and video art, pushing the envelope in Lebanon’s art scene. And in 2022, a short film from Tunisia titled Aysha depicted a transgender girl’s experience (though it faced challenges in distribution). These early efforts mirror how gay characters first tiptoed into Arab cinema: via the independent circuit, film festivals, and short films, eventually paving the way for more prominent depictions.

One reason Arab mainstream cinema lags is overt censorship and risk. In countries like Saudi Arabia or the Gulf, depicting a trans character positively in a local film could result in the film being banned and the filmmakers penalized. Even in Egypt, which has a storied cinema industry, government censors and societal gatekeepers (like cinema owners) would likely block a movie centered on a transgender protagonist, at least at present. This means that any significant Arab work on the theme might need to be a co-production with Europe or made outside the official channels. When it does happen, it could make waves akin to how The Yacoubian Building (2006) caused controversy for including a gay subplot – except trans issues are even less understood. Education through media is sorely needed first.

In the interim, much of the representation happens in the documentary space or through international platforms. For example, a recent Arabic docu-series on an online platform featured an episode about a trans woman in Egypt navigating her transition amid bureaucratic and social hurdles. Such content, while not theatrical cinema, is building awareness. Social media, too, has allowed some young trans Arabs to share their transitions with a broad audience, somewhat bypassing traditional media.

To sum up the mainstream angle: Turkey has made striking strides by incorporating trans characters into popular entertainment (owing in part to a relatively vibrant public discourse on gender until recent clampdowns). Iran and the Arab countries remain more constrained in their mainstream media, but independent and documentary films have carried the torch, and small breakthroughs (like minor trans characters or trans actors in TV series) are starting to occur. Every time a trans person appears on an Arab talk show, or an actor portrays a trans role sympathetically, it chips away at the taboo.

Negotiating Visibility, Censorship, and Authenticity
Across the examples discussed – from Iranian gender-bending dramas to intimate documentaries and Turkish comedies – certain recurring themes emerge in how MENA films negotiate visibility, censorship, authenticity, and local gender norms. We turn now to explicitly address these aspects and consider the broader question: do these films challenge or reinforce dominant norms?

Visibility: One of the clear aims of many of these films is to render visible a population that has been largely invisible or misrepresented in mainstream discourse. In doing so, filmmakers often walk a tightrope. Complete invisibility is the baseline they are pushing against – in many societies of the region, the existence of transgender people has been publicly denied or erased. These films, by their very existence, assert visibility. In Facing Mirrors, for example, the simple act of naming a trans character and telling his story in a narrative feature forces Iranian audiences to acknowledge: trans people exist among us, with their own struggles and dreams. Similarly, Be Like Others shined a light on dozens of trans individuals going through Iran’s clinics, contradicting any claim that this is just a “Western phenomenon.” The Belle from Gaza illuminates a tiny, hidden subgroup (trans Gazans) in a very charged context, allowing their faces and voices to be seen and heard. Meanwhile, Aile Arasında, by embedding a trans woman in a popular film, increased visibility in a perhaps even more potent way: it made a trans person an everyday figure in a fun family story, introducing her to audiences who might never watch an art film or a documentary on the subject.

However, visibility can be double-edged. With it can come backlash. Filmmakers thus sometimes employ strategies to buffer their trans characters behind metaphor or humor, to make the visibility more palatable. The Iranian practice of the transgender move is one such buffer – it gave a taste of gender transgression without explicitly asserting trans identities, and thus slipped visibility in through a crack in the door. In contrast, documentary filmmakers tend to take a more direct approach, as their purpose is often advocacy or at least truth-telling. They assume the risk of visibility in exchange for authenticity. The individuals who appear in these docs are themselves heroic for choosing to be seen – knowing it might endanger them or invite personal criticism.

Censorship: Official censorship remains a formidable barrier in much of MENA. How have the films dealt with it? Iranian filmmakers leveraged ambiguity and the regime’s own contradictions. Because Iran legally allows trans medical treatment, a film like Facing Mirrors could be framed (if one were pitching it to authorities) as a story about someone pursuing a legally sanctioned path – not about gay romance or anything explicitly “seditious.” Nevertheless, Facing Mirrors still faced conservative ire and mostly found its audience abroad and in indie screenings. The censorship code in Iran has concrete rules (for example, women must wear hijab on screen even at home, men and women cannot touch if not married, etc.), which ironically helped spawn the cross-dressing trope ([Cross-Dressing and Gender (Tres)Passing: The Transgender Move as a Site of Agential Potential in the New Iranian Cinema | Hypatia | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/crossdressing-and-gender-trespassing-the-transgender-move-as-a-site-of-agential-potential-in-the-new-iranian-cinema/B3633A4D5371D77758504C6CBBBF635E#:~:text=censorship code enforced by the,Dokhtaraneh Khorshid—two films that are)). By having female characters dress as males, some directors navigated around rules about segregating the sexes on film. This practical workaround was exploited to powerful thematic effect.

In Arab countries, strict censorship (and self-censorship by producers) largely kept trans themes off the screen. Where they have appeared, it’s usually because the film is a festival piece not intended for wide Arab release, thereby sidestepping local censors. For instance, All My Life (Egypt) was never shown publicly in Egypt due to censorship; it circulated in underground venues and internationally. Documentaries like Cinema Fouad might have been shown on a small scale or academic context in Lebanon but not widely on TV. One interesting example is Saudi Arabia’s nascent film industry: in 2020, a short Saudi film about a trans man’s experience (based on a true story of an FTM individual in a conservative town) was reportedly made, but it predictably could not screen in the Kingdom; it only appeared in foreign festival lineups. This shows that while censorship stymies local visibility, the drive to tell these stories still exists and finds a way, even if it’s essentially in exile or online. The advent of streaming platforms and YouTube has somewhat weakened state censorship power, as content can reach viewers without passing through theaters or TV channels.

Several films also use narrative censorship as a theme. Characters have to censor themselves within the story – e.g., Eddie in Facing Mirrors initially hides his identity from Rana; Behiye in Aile Arasında must conceal from the in-laws. These plot points reflect the real social censorship trans people live under. When characters decide to disclose or when they are outed, the reactions of others dramatize the stigma and prejudices the censors ostensibly are “protecting” the public from. In doing so, the films critique censorship: they show that silence and hiding cause pain, whereas openness can lead to understanding (as with Rana eventually understanding Eddie, or Solmaz’s friends embracing Behiye).

Authenticity: Authentic representation is a crucial concern, encompassing who tells the story, who plays the roles, and how true to lived experiences the narratives are. In terms of casting, there is a spectrum. On one end, we have Ayta Sözeri in Aile Arasında – a trans actress playing a trans character, bringing her authentic self to the role ([[PDF] Being Queer in Turkish Cinema: Existence, Appearance, and ...](https://cinej.pitt.edu/ojs/cinej/article/view/603/745#:~:text=,with the same gender identity)). On the other end, we have cisgender actors playing trans roles, like Shayesteh Irani as Eddie in Facing Mirrors. While Irani gave a commendable performance, one might ask how a trans man in Iran would have interpreted that role or if one could have even been cast given social limits. Documentaries, by definition, cast real trans people as themselves, maximizing authenticity of presence (though the filmmaking and editing are still an authored construct). Each approach has merits and pitfalls: using trans actors can add credibility and avoid the impression of trans people being spoken about rather than allowed to speak. However, in environments where trans visibility is minimal, finding a professional trans actor can be challenging; moreover, a trans person might not be safe taking a public role.

The films we discussed generally handle authenticity with care. Be Like Others is raw in showing real emotions and even the physical transition process – it doesn’t sugarcoat the difficulties (one sees depression, family rejection, and health risks), thereby giving a genuine portrait. The Belle from Gaza likely similarly gains authenticity simply by the fact that no scriptwriter could invent the nuanced reality of being trans in Gaza – only those living it know it. On the fiction side, Facing Mirrors was developed with input from the Iranian trans community to ensure cultural accuracy (for example, it correctly portrays the pressure of forced marriage and the need to obtain a passport for surgery, details rooted in Iranian reality ([Facing Mirrors](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors#:~:text=Iranian narrative film with a,off to a male cousin))). Negar Azarbayjani reportedly even consulted trans Iranians in the diaspora when writing the script. Such efforts show a commitment to authenticity beyond what appears on screen.

Authenticity also relates to language and terminology. In some of these films, characters struggle to even find words for their identity in their native tongue. Rana in Facing Mirrors doesn’t know the word “transgender” (trans in English is used in the film, indicating the Persian language’s adoption of an English loan-word for the concept). In Be Like Others, some parents refer to their child as “mukhannas” (effeminate) or use other traditional terms before learning the clinical “transsexuāl”. These linguistic details matter: they reveal how local understandings are catching up with global terminology. A translator or subtitle might gloss over this, but within the film, these moments are significant – they dramatize the very naming of identity as an act of authenticity. To name oneself (as Eddie insists on being called by his chosen name, for instance) is to assert one’s reality. Thus, when films allow trans characters to name themselves and tell their stories in their own words, they deeply challenge the norm of imposed identity.

Local Understandings of Gender: MENA cultures have their own frameworks that can both clash with and, at times, accommodate transgender identities. For instance, in Iran there is a religious-fatwa-backed framing that being trans is a condition with a medical solution. Some trans Iranians accept this framing to get family buy-in, others chafe at being seen as “ill” but go through the motions to get legal recognition. Be Like Others shows these nuances: one subject’s mother takes comfort in believing it’s a cure and says “my son is sick and now will be healthy,” which is bittersweet for the trans daughter who likely doesn’t see herself as formerly diseased, just born in a difficult situation. In Arab contexts, trans people are often conflated with gay people under the umbrella of “shadh” (deviant) or “lūtī” (a derogatory reference to Lot’s people). Few in the general public differentiate gender identity from sexual orientation, which poses a representational challenge: a filmmaker might have to clarify this distinction within the story. Facing Mirrors took on this task by pairing Eddie’s storyline with Rana’s misconceptions to educate the audience by proxy – as Rana learns, so does the viewer. In Aile Arasında, interestingly, the film doesn’t explicate anything about Behiye’s past or medical status; she is simply accepted as a woman by her friends. Turkey’s society has some familiarity with trans figures (there have been prominent trans singers, and the word “transseksüel” is understood by many), so the film didn’t need to define terms – a sign of relatively advanced understanding.

These films generally push local understandings toward a more compassionate, human-rights-based view. They present trans individuals not as perverse or laughable, but as people wanting to live authentically. They often highlight commonalities between trans folk and others – e.g., Eddie and Rana’s shared experience of societal oppression, or how Behiye just wants friendship and love like anyone else. This approach challenges the othering narratives dominant in society. However, some films do depict the lack of understanding around them, which is part of the negotiation. For instance, the violent or cruel reactions of certain side characters (like thugs trying to assault Eddie, or an uncle insulting a trans sex worker in Other Angels) are shown unflinchingly. The films don’t exist in a utopia; they show trans folks navigating very real dangers and misunderstandings. By doing so, the filmmakers call out those oppressive attitudes – effectively inviting the audience to critique the status quo.

Challenging vs. Reinforcing Norms: Ultimately, do these films challenge or reinforce the dominant norms of gender and sexuality? The evidence leans heavily towards challenge, though with varying degrees of radicalness.

Challenging norms: All the films discussed bring transgender experiences to the forefront in societies that marginalize them. They challenge the norm of silence by speaking, the norm of shame by showing pride or at least dignity, and the norm of exclusion by fostering empathy and inclusion. Facing Mirrors challenges the patriarchal norm that assigns women a certain fate – Eddie refuses the arranged marriage and chooses his own path, and Rana breaks out of her patriarchal mindset to support him. Be Like Others directly challenges the moral norm that “homosexuality is shameful” by exposing the cruelty of that belief and implicitly asking why people must drastically alter themselves to be free of harassment ([Be Like Others - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others#:~:text=they are not homosexual%2C seeing,to live free from harassment)). Aile Arasında challenges cinematic norms by placing a trans character in a positive, central light within a mainstream movie, which in turn challenges audience prejudices. The Belle from Gaza challenges both conservative Palestinian norms (by portraying trans women as real and sympathetic) and any Israeli norms that might view Palestinians monolithically (by highlighting a shared humanity). Furthermore, many of these films have an activist bent: they aim to educate and shift perspectives, which is inherently a challenge to the status quo.
Reinforcing norms: There are some instances where, to get their message across or to appease censorship, films carefully balance on the line of not overtly overthrowing certain norms. For example, Iranian cross-dressing films often reinforced the gender binary by ending with a return to assigned gender, as discussed. One could argue this reinforcement was a necessary compromise and that the subversive reading outweighs the surface compliance. In Be Like Others, one might worry that the film inadvertently reinforces the regime’s narrative by showing many people transitioning – but the critical tone and emphasis on the psychological toll counters that, presenting it as individuals adapting under duress, not endorsing the norm that they should have to. Aile Arasında reinforces the idea that it’s easier to avoid conflict than to confront it – Behiye doesn’t come out to the conservative family in a teachable moment; instead the strategy is to keep her status quiet. This could be read as reinforcing the societal norm of “don’t ask, don’t tell” regarding trans folks in certain settings. However, within the comedic context, this was likely a pragmatic choice to keep the tone light. It doesn’t explicitly endorse that norm as correct; if anything, it mocks the absurdity that they have to hide at all.
Another aspect to consider is whether the films reinforce any stereotypes. For instance, do they always depict trans women as sex workers or trans people as suffering? Other Angels could be critiqued for focusing on sex workers, but that was also a realist portrayal of a known community in Istanbul. Be Like Others shows trans women mostly in somewhat desperate circumstances (which was accurate for many in Iran), but it also showed their resilience and normal moments like socializing or celebrating a birthday, giving a rounded picture beyond just victimhood. Facing Mirrors portrays a trans man from a wealthy background – breaking the stereotype that trans issues only occur on society’s fringes. And Aile Arasında decidedly breaks stereotypes by portraying a trans woman not as a tragic figure or hyper-sexual object, but as a comical, wise auntie.

In the balance, the ideological thrust of these films is to question and expand norms rather than reinforce them. Even when they operate within some limitations, they tend to use those constraints judo-like to flip perspective. Iranian filmmakers used the forced invisibility of women (via compulsory veiling and separation) to craft stories where women become “visible” by cross-dressing as men, ironically highlighting the arbitrariness of those gender rules. Documentary makers used the very words of conservative family members on camera to reveal their flawed understanding, hoping audiences would see the need for change.

It’s also worth noting that reception matters. A film might challenge norms, but if it only preaches to the choir (festival audiences, etc.), its effect on society is limited. However, when a film like Aile Arasında becomes a hit, it suggests a crack in the public’s resistance. Likewise, Facing Mirrors won awards at Iranian and international festivals, indicating it resonated even within Iran’s own arts community. Be Like Others reportedly moved some Iranian viewers (who saw it via satellite TV or bootlegs) to reconsider their attitudes. Over time, accumulatively, these cultural products can shift the Overton window of what is discussable and acceptable.

In concluding this section, one can say the filmmakers and trans subjects featured in these works are agents of change. They engage in what Deleuze would call “lines of flight” – escaping the rigid stratifications of gender and genre, they carve out new spaces in film narrative. They take the minor position (trans voices in a cisnormative, heteronormative society) and make cinema that speaks to major audiences with a collective, political voice ([Minor cinema - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_cinema#:~:text=1,collective enunciation)). This is art in service of social evolution. And while some norms – especially deep-seated ones – are slow to budge, these films have undeniably injected new ideas and empathy into the cultural conversation in MENA societies.

Conclusion
Transgender themes in Middle Eastern and North African cinema have transitioned – in both content and form – from near-invisibility to emerging visibility, from metaphorical expression to candid exploration. Through a range of storytelling modes, filmmakers in the region have started to tell the stories of those who live between or beyond the gender binaries enforced by their societies. In doing so, they have not only expanded the cinematic imagination of the MENA region but also challenged audiences to rethink notions of gender, identity, and freedom.

Our broad overview showed that historical and cultural contexts have heavily shaped these representations. The weight of religious and societal conservatism meant early depictions of anything queer or trans had to be subtle, coded, or framed within “acceptable” tropes (such as the cross-dressing survival narratives in Iranian cinema). Yet, even within those constraints, we identified a “transgender move” – a deliberate narrative strategy that created space for gender transgression, if only temporarily ([Cross-Dressing and Gender (Tres)Passing: The Transgender Move as a Site of Agential Potential in the New Iranian Cinema | Hypatia | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/crossdressing-and-gender-trespassing-the-transgender-move-as-a-site-of-agential-potential-in-the-new-iranian-cinema/B3633A4D5371D77758504C6CBBBF635E#:~:text=censorship code enforced by the,Dokhtaraneh Khorshid—two films that are)) ([Cross-Dressing and Gender (Tres)Passing: The Transgender Move as a Site of Agential Potential in the New Iranian Cinema | Hypatia | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/crossdressing-and-gender-trespassing-the-transgender-move-as-a-site-of-agential-potential-in-the-new-iranian-cinema/B3633A4D5371D77758504C6CBBBF635E#:~:text=figure—I identify a “transgender move”%3A,post 1990s New Iranian cinema)). This underscores a key point: art finds ways to speak the unspeakable. In Iran, the very censorship that tried to enforce gender segregation on screen inadvertently gave rise to films that blurred gender – a poignant example of creative resistance.

By incorporating trans theory, we illuminated how these films resonate with global understandings of gender as performance and social construct. Butler’s ideas on performativity are almost visually enacted by characters like Baran/Rahmat donning a new identity ([Judith Butler Quote: “Gender is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of...”](https://quotefancy.com/quote/1116187/Judith-Butler-Gender-is-an-identity-tenuously-constituted-in-time-instituted-in-an#:~:text=“Gender is an identity tenuously,”)). Stryker’s insights on the perceived “falsehood” of trans lives were used to critique exactly the misconceptions these films work against ([Trans Cinema and its Exit Scapes: A Transfeminist Reading of Utopian Sensibility and Gender Dissidence in Contemporary Film](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:742465/FULLTEXT02.pdf#:~:text=Tomboy 2011),about gender onto the body)). Halberstam’s concept of a transgender gaze helped us see when and how films let trans characters control their own image and narrative vantage point ([Trans Cinema and its Exit Scapes: A Transfeminist Reading of Utopian Sensibility and Gender Dissidence in Contemporary Film](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:742465/FULLTEXT02.pdf#:~:text=Cinema in the book In,The next)). And hooks’ oppositional gaze concept provided a framework for recognizing acts of defiance in looking – whether it’s a trans character staring down bigotry or a filmmaker turning the camera toward those whom society wants to ignore ([The Black Gaze - the facts of whiteness](https://thefactsofwhiteness.org/the-black-gaze/#:~:text=The Black Gaze ,hooks%2C 1992%2C p116)). These theoretical connections show that while the MENA context is unique, the core issues of representation, gaze, and identity politics are part of a larger human conversation to which these films richly contribute.

In the detailed analyses of Facing Mirrors, Be Like Others, Aile Arasında, and others, we saw concrete examples of how narrative and cinematic techniques can humanize or objectify, challenge or concede. Facing Mirrors stood out as a culturally specific yet universally relatable drama of empathy overcoming ignorance, effectively modeling how understanding can be reached across a divide of experience ([Facing Mirrors](https://www.frameline.org/films/frameline36/facing-mirrors#:~:text=Eddie tries to explain that,their class and ethical differences)). Be Like Others provided an unvarnished look at the collision between an individual’s truth and a society’s dictates ([Be Like Others - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others#:~:text=Although homosexual relationships are illegal,Others shows the experiences of)) ([Be Like Others - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others#:~:text=they are not homosexual%2C seeing,to live free from harassment)), raising complex questions about authenticity that have no easy answer but demand contemplation. Aile Arasında delivered perhaps the most joyful portrayal, suggesting that laughter and love can erode prejudice more subtly but no less effectively ([‎In the Family (2017) directed by Ozan Açıktan • Reviews, film + cast • Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/film/in-the-family-2017/#:~:text=turkish cinema%3A aile arasinda%3A ,absolute goddesses on the stage)). And The Belle from Gaza reminds us that transgender issues intersect with other axes of identity – nationality, religion, class – and that liberation is a multifaceted journey.

Do these films challenge or reinforce dominant norms? Largely, they challenge – sometimes quietly, sometimes overtly. They challenge the cinematic norm that often rendered queer and trans people invisible or one-dimensional. They challenge the social norm that says gender variance is shameful or non-existent. They challenge audiences to find compassion and even to question their own preconceived binaries. In some cases, to reach an audience at all, a film might portray a temporary return to norms (as in Iran’s cross-dressers reverting to female roles) or avoid direct confrontation (as in comedy’s tactful sidestepping of bigots). But these should be seen as strategic compromises at most. The thrust of the narrative in each case still foregrounds the inner truth and dignity of the trans character, thereby planting a seed of doubt in viewers’ minds about the absolute authority of existing norms.

Furthermore, these films serve as a mirror to MENA societies. As cinema often does, they reflect social changes while also projecting aspirational possibilities. In Iran, the growing visibility of trans individuals in film and media mirrors the relatively unique legal space trans people occupy, and perhaps paves the way for broader understanding that being trans is not a “Western import” but part of the fabric of Iranian society. In Turkey, Aile Arasında mirrored an era of cultural opening (however limited and possibly receding) and also presented a hopeful image of acceptance within family and friendship circles that viewers could emulate. For the Arab world, the relative paucity of trans characters on screen is itself a mirror of continued social resistance, but the few instances we have point toward cracks in the facade – indicating that new narratives are on the horizon as activists and artists push boundaries.

In conclusion, the representation of transgender themes in MENA cinema is an evolving story – one of courage, creativity, and gradual change. It parallels the broader struggle for transgender rights and recognition in these societies. Each film analyzed here is, in its own way, an act of advocacy as much as artistry. Together, they form a nascent but growing trans cinema of the Middle East and North Africa. Its significance is not just in portraying transgender lives, but in using film as a means to transform understanding. These works invite viewers to witness the performative acts by which gender is constituted ([Judith Butler Quote: “Gender is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of...”](https://quotefancy.com/quote/1116187/Judith-Butler-Gender-is-an-identity-tenuously-constituted-in-time-instituted-in-an#:~:text=“Gender is an identity tenuously,”)) – and in doing so, to realize that other performances (other lives, other truths) are possible and valid. They exemplify how, in a region where looking openly can be an act of defiance, the simple act of showing a trans person’s face and story on screen becomes a powerful declaration: we are here, our lives matter, and our stories belong in the tapestry of cultural narrative. The journey is ongoing, but these films have lit the path forward, using the camera as a tool of both revelation and revolution in equal measure.
