Study Notes on the Diamond Sutra (Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra): Philosophy, Interpretation, and Application
I. Introduction to the Diamond Sutra (Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra): Significance, Place within Mahayana and Prajnaparamita Literature
A. Overview and Significance
The Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, commonly known in English as the Diamond Sutra, stands as one of the most influential and revered scriptures within Mahāyāna Buddhism.1 Despite its relative brevity, capable of being read in under an hour by some accounts 1, the Sutra delves into profound philosophical depths concerning the nature of reality, perception, and enlightenment.1 Its teachings have captivated scholars, monastics, and lay practitioners for well over 1,500 years, particularly across East Asia where it has been widely memorized, recited, and venerated.2 Its historical importance is underscored by the discovery of a printed copy dated 868 CE among the Dunhuang manuscripts, widely considered the world's oldest dated, complete printed book.1 This artifact highlights the Sutra's profound cultural and spiritual legacy.1

The title itself, Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, translates roughly as "The Perfection of Wisdom Sutra that Cuts Like a Diamond" or "The Perfection of Wisdom Text that Cuts Like a Thunderbolt".1 The vajra, symbolizing both the indestructible diamond and the irresistible thunderbolt, serves as a potent metaphor for the nature of the wisdom (prajñā) imparted within the text.1 This wisdom is presented as having the power to cut through layers of illusion, attachment, and conceptual fabrication, ultimately revealing the true nature of reality.1 The title thus functions as a pedagogical primer, alerting the reader to the text's incisive and deconstructive approach to deeply ingrained assumptions about existence.1

The Diamond Sutra's enduring appeal, despite its challenging philosophical content and paradoxical style, points to its ability to address fundamental human concerns about reality, suffering, and liberation.1 Its relative brevity facilitated memorization and ritual chanting, embedding it deeply within Buddhist devotional life across Asia.2 This dual function—as a profound philosophical treatise and a potent object of devotion believed to confer merit and protection 2—explains its unique position and lasting influence within the Buddhist world.

B. Place within Prajnaparamita Literature
The Diamond Sutra belongs to the Prajñāpāramitā ("Perfection of Wisdom") genre, a major body of Mahāyāna Buddhist literature that emerged around the beginning of the Common Era.1 This literature represents the oldest major form of Mahāyāna Buddhism 80 and radically extends the earlier Buddhist concept of ontological voidness (śūnyatā).80 The central theme across these texts is the "perfection of wisdom" (prajñāpāramitā), understood as the direct realization of emptiness – the understanding that all phenomena lack inherent, independent existence (svabhāva).16 This wisdom is considered the supreme perfection (pāramitā) and the primary path to nirvāṇa in Mahāyāna thought.80

The Diamond Sutra is often compared to the Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya Sūtra (Heart Sutra), another concise and highly influential text from this genre.2 Both emphasize emptiness and non-attachment.24 However, the Heart Sutra is even shorter and focuses intensely on the emptiness of the five aggregates (skandhas).34 The Diamond Sutra, while also concise, elaborates more extensively on the Bodhisattva path, the nature of perception, the illusory nature of phenomena beyond the aggregates, and the immense merit associated with upholding its teachings.1 Some traditions view the Heart Sutra as a distillation of the Diamond Sutra 24, while the Diamond Sutra itself is often seen as summarizing the core message of the much larger Prajnaparamita texts, such as the versions in 8,000, 18,000, 25,000, or 100,000 lines.15 However, the exact relationship and chronology remain subjects of scholarly discussion, with some suggesting the Diamond Sutra might represent an earlier stratum of the literature.15

C. Structure and Style
The Diamond Sutra primarily takes the form of a dialogue between the historical Buddha, Śākyamuni (referred to as the Bhagavān or Tathāgata), and one of his senior disciples, the elder Subhūti.1 Subhūti, recognized in both Theravāda and Mahāyāna traditions, is particularly renowned in Mahāyāna as the disciple foremost in understanding emptiness (śūnyatā).16 His role as the primary interlocutor is significant, as the dialogue often portrays the Buddha guiding Subhūti from an Arhat's understanding of emptiness towards the more profound Mahāyāna/Bodhisattva perspective.15

The Sutra's distinctive stylistic feature is its pervasive use of negation and paradox.1 It frequently employs a formula often characterized as the "logic of not": a concept 'A' is presented, then declared to be 'not A' (in the sense of lacking inherent existence), and finally reaffirmed as conventionally designated 'A'.2 This linguistic strategy, along with repetition 24, aims to deconstruct fixed conceptual frameworks, undermine attachment to language and ideas, and point directly towards the understanding of emptiness and non-duality.2 This approach makes the Sutra particularly resonant with the Chan (Zen) tradition.1

II. Core Philosophical Teachings
The Diamond Sutra articulates several foundational Mahāyāna philosophical concepts, primarily revolving around the nature of reality as empty and illusory, and the path of the Bodhisattva grounded in non-attachment and compassion.

A. Emptiness (Śūnyatā): Deconstructing Inherent Existence
The central philosophical pillar of the Diamond Sutra is the concept of emptiness, śūnyatā, although the term itself is notably absent from the text.2 Instead of direct definition, the Sutra demonstrates emptiness through negation and paradox. Śūnyatā signifies that all phenomena (dharmas), including the perceived self, lack svabhāva – an intrinsic, independent, unchanging essence or self-nature.1 Things appear to exist substantially and independently only due to the power of conventional language and conceptual thought.2

Crucially, emptiness is not presented as nihilism or the denial of existence altogether.24 Instead, it points to the doctrine of dependent origination (pratītya-samutpāda), meaning that all things arise in dependence upon causes and conditions.2 It is precisely because things are empty of fixed, inherent existence that they can change, interact, and function.19 The Sutra emphasizes a non-dual understanding where form (phenomena) and emptiness are not separate realities; rather, "form is emptiness, emptiness is form".15 This "true emptiness" moves beyond the mere absence of self (anatman) understood by Arhats to the realization of the dynamic interplay between conventional and ultimate reality.15

B. Non-Attachment (Anabhinivesa) and Non-Abiding (Apratiṣṭha): Freedom from Clinging
Arising directly from the understanding of emptiness is the crucial practice of non-attachment (anabhinivesa).81 The Diamond Sutra repeatedly exhorts practitioners to relinquish clinging in all its forms.1 This includes attachment to the notion of a separate self (ātman), to other beings (sattva), to phenomena (dharma), to concepts and views, to sensory experiences (forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touch), to the idea of merit, and even to the Buddhist teachings (Dharma) and the state of enlightenment itself.2 The understanding of emptiness provides the rationale: if all things lack inherent substance, there is fundamentally nothing to grasp onto.1

A key expression of this principle is the concept of the "non-abiding mind" (apratistha). The Sutra famously instructs Bodhisattvas to "develop a mind that functions freely, without depending on anything or any place," or to "give rise to a mind without any attachments".1 This means the mind should not fixate or "abide" on any sensory object, mental object, concept, or state of being. This non-abiding state is considered crucial for liberation and is a central tenet in Chan/Zen Buddhism, which was heavily influenced by the Diamond Sutra.2

C. The Illusory Nature of Self (Anatman) and Phenomena (Dharmas)
The Diamond Sutra rigorously applies the principle of emptiness to deconstruct the perceived reality of both the individual self and external phenomena.

The doctrine of anatman (no-self or not-self) is a major theme.2 The Sutra asserts that the conventional notions of a self, a person, a living being (sattva), or a life span/soul (jīva/pudgala) are arbitrary illusions (saṃjñā).1 Clinging to these notions prevents one from being a true Bodhisattva.2 The Buddha employs the "logic of not" to deconstruct this idea: "'All beings', Subhuti, have been preached by the Tathagata as beingless. That is why they are called 'all beings'".2 This signifies that the conventional designation "being" is pragmatically useful but does not correspond to an ultimately real, independent entity.

This deconstruction extends to all phenomena, or dharmas. The Sutra teaches that all conditioned phenomena are ultimately illusory and lack substance.2 The famous concluding gāthā (verse) uses powerful metaphors: "All conditioned phenomena / Are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, or shadows; / Like drops of dew, or flashes of lightning; / Thusly should they be contemplated".1 Again, the "logic of not" is applied: "As far as 'all dharmas' are concerned, Subhuti, all of them are dharma-less. That is why they are called 'all dharmas'".2 This indicates that phenomena, while appearing distinct and real conventionally, are ultimately empty of self-nature and exist only dependently.

D. Perception, Reality, and Non-Duality
The Diamond Sutra fundamentally challenges our ordinary modes of perception, revealing them as constructed and limited, and points towards a non-dual understanding of reality.

Conventional perception is depicted as being based on grasping at forms, signs, concepts, and labels.1 These mental constructs create a distorted view, an illusion (māyā) that obscures the true nature of things.1 The Sutra aims to help practitioners "unlearn" these preconceived notions.2 True perception, often symbolized by "seeing the Tathāgata," involves recognizing the illusory nature of forms and appearances ("All that has a form is illusive and unreal") and perceiving the underlying reality beyond these constructs.15

Reality, as depicted in the Diamond Sutra, is fundamentally characterized by emptiness (śūnyatā), impermanence (anitya), interdependence (pratītya-samutpāda), and its ultimately illusory nature.1 The concluding verse powerfully summarizes this view, comparing conditioned existence to transient phenomena like dreams, bubbles, and lightning flashes.1

Ultimately, the Sutra guides the practitioner towards a non-dual perspective, transcending the dichotomies that structure conventional thought, such as self and other, existence and non-existence, form and emptiness, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.1 Reality is presented as "not two" (advaya), a unified field where apparent opposites are understood as interdependent aspects of a single whole.15

The philosophical concepts presented in the Diamond Sutra—emptiness, non-attachment, the illusory nature of self and phenomena—form a cohesive and interdependent framework. The ontological claim of emptiness (that things lack inherent existence) provides the logical foundation for the primary practice of non-attachment (as there is nothing substantial to cling to) and necessitates the deconstruction of the conventional self (which is also empty). This understanding of reality as empty and illusory is not merely an intellectual exercise; its purpose is fundamentally soteriological—aimed at liberation from suffering (duḥkha).1 Suffering arises from clinging to illusory notions of permanence, self, and inherent existence. By cutting through these illusions with the "diamond" of wisdom (prajñā), the Sutra offers a path to transcend suffering and achieve enlightenment. This pragmatic orientation 2 explains why the text interweaves profound philosophical deconstruction with practical instructions on non-attachment, compassion, and the Bodhisattva path.

III. Analysis of Key Passages and Dialogues
The Diamond Sutra conveys its core teachings through a series of dialogues rich in paradox and negation. Examining key passages reveals the consistent application of its central themes and its unique pedagogical approach.

A. The "Logic of Not" / Paradoxical Statements (e.g., "A is not A, therefore A is A")
A hallmark of the Diamond Sutra is its recurrent use of paradoxical statements, often following the pattern "What is called A, is not A, therefore it is called A".2 This structure, termed the "logic of not" (na pṛthak) by Japanese Buddhologist Hajime Nakamura 2, functions as follows:

Affirmation: A conventional concept or entity ('A') is introduced (e.g., "all dharmas," "streams of thought," "all beings," "highest teaching").
Negation: The inherent reality or substantiality of 'A' is denied ("dharma-less," "streamless," "beingless," "not the highest teaching"). This points to its emptiness (śūnyatā) or lack of svabhāva.
Reaffirmation: The conventional designation 'A' is reaffirmed ("That is why they are called 'all dharmas'/ 'streams of thought'/ 'all beings'/ 'highest teaching'"). This acknowledges the pragmatic validity and conventional use of the term, despite its ultimate emptiness.2
Examples abound:

"As far as 'all dharmas' are concerned, Subhuti, all of them are dharma-less. That is why they are called 'all dharmas'." 2
"Those so-called 'streams of thought', Subhuti, have been preached by the Tathagata as streamless. That is why they are called 'streams of thought'." 2
"'All beings', Subhuti, have been preached by the Tathagata as beingless. That is why they are called 'all beings'." 2
"What is called the highest teaching is not the highest teaching". 17 (This example often omits the explicit reaffirmation, but the implication remains).
The purpose of this repetitive, paradoxical method is multi-faceted. It aims to dismantle the practitioner's attachment to language and the concepts it reifies, recognizing that language can obscure the fluid, unfixed nature of reality.2 It reveals the ultimately illusory nature of all phenomena 2 and points towards a non-dual understanding that transcends conventional dichotomies.89 This approach avoids the extremes of linguistic usage—neither reifying concepts into ultimate realities nor dismissing them as entirely meaningless, thus preserving their pragmatic value for communication and practice.2 The "diamond" quality of the Sutra's wisdom lies precisely in this ability to cut through layers of conceptualization.1

B. The Liberation of Beings (Chapter 3)
One of the most striking and frequently cited passages occurs early in the Sutra, where the Buddha outlines the Bodhisattva's aspiration:

"All living beings, whether born from eggs, from the womb, from moisture, or spontaneously; whether they have form or do not have form; whether they are aware or unaware... all living beings will eventually be led by me to the final Nirvana... And when this unfathomable, infinite number of living beings have all been liberated, in truth not even a single being has actually been liberated." 2

The passage continues, explaining why no being has truly been liberated: "Because if a disciple still clings to the arbitrary illusions of form or phenomena such as an ego, a personality, a self, a separate person, or a universal self existing eternally, then that person is not an authentic disciple." 2

This passage encapsulates several core Mahāyāna themes:

The Bodhisattva Ideal: It clearly defines the Mahāyāna path's motivation – the compassionate vow (bodhicitta) to liberate all sentient beings without exception.1
Emptiness of Beings: The paradox ("no being has actually been liberated") directly illustrates the emptiness of the concept of "being." From the ultimate perspective, grounded in the wisdom of emptiness, there are no inherently existing, separate beings to be liberated. The Bodhisattva acts out of compassion within the conventional world but understands the ultimate non-existence of fixed selves.2
Non-Attachment to Self/Other: Liberation is achieved precisely by abandoning the conceptual distinctions between self, person, being, and lifespan.2 This highlights the non-dual view where the distinction between the liberator and the liberated dissolves in the light of emptiness.
C. Giving Without Attachment (Chapter 4)
The Sutra elaborates on the practice of the first perfection (pāramitā), generosity (dāna), emphasizing its connection to non-attachment:

"Furthermore, Subhuti, in the practice of compassion and charity a disciple should be detached. That is to say, he should practice compassion and charity without regard to appearances, without regard to form, without regard to sound, smell, taste, touch, or any quality of any kind... Because practicing compassion and charity without attachment is the way to reaching the Highest Perfect Wisdom...".17

Further passages reinforce this: "bodhisattvas should give a gift without being attached to a thing... without being attached to the perception of an object".114 The Buddha asks Subhuti if space can be measured, and upon Subhuti's denial, compares the immeasurable nature of space to the immeasurable merit accrued by a Bodhisattva who gives without attachment.17

The significance of this passage lies in:

Defining True Generosity: It defines the Mahāyāna understanding of perfect generosity not merely by the act of giving, but by the state of mind accompanying it – one free from attachment to the giver, the receiver, the gift, or any sensory or conceptual characteristic associated with the act.16 This is sometimes referred to as the "three wheels being empty" (trimaṇḍala-pariśuddhi).115
Linking Practice and Wisdom: It explicitly connects the practice of generosity (dāna) with the attainment of Highest Perfect Wisdom (prajñāpāramitā), showing that ethical action must be grounded in the understanding of emptiness and non-attachment.17
Immeasurable Merit: It redefines merit, suggesting that the merit gained from detached, wisdom-infused generosity is boundless and immeasurable, unlike merit tied to conventional actions or expectations.17 This "great merit" is itself understood as empty.15
D. Perceiving the Buddha (Chapters 5, 26)
The Sutra challenges conventional ways of perceiving the Buddha, particularly through physical form or attributes.

In Chapter 5, the Buddha asks Subhuti, "Can the Buddha be recognized by means of his bodily form?" Subhuti correctly replies, "No, Most Honored One... Because when the Buddha speaks of bodily form, it is not a real form, but only an illusion." The Buddha confirms, "All that has a form is illusive and unreal. When you see that all forms are illusive and unreal, then you will begin to perceive your true Buddha nature.".17

Later, in Chapter 26 (in the common Chinese division), this is reinforced with a verse:

"Someone who looks for me in form / or seeks me in sound / is on a mistaken path / and cannot see the Tathagata.".116

These passages are significant because they:

Emphasize Emptiness of Form: They directly apply the principle of emptiness to the Buddha's own physical manifestation, teaching that even the revered form of the Buddha is ultimately illusory and not the true nature of Buddhahood.17
Point Beyond Attributes: They guide the practitioner to look beyond physical characteristics (like the traditional 32 marks of a great man, which the Sutra implicitly deconstructs 19) and sensory perception (sight, sound) to understand the true nature of the Tathāgata.116
Introduce Dharmakāya: While not explicitly named, these passages point towards the Mahāyāna concept of the Dharmakāya (Dharma-body) – the ultimate, formless, true nature of a Buddha, which is equated with emptiness and ultimate reality, distinct from the physical (Nirmāṇakāya) or celestial (Sambhogakāya) bodies.3 Seeing the "true Buddha nature" means perceiving this formless reality.
E. The Raft Metaphor (Chapter 6)
Chapter 6 contains a famous metaphor...source concepts and ideas about spiritual things need to be explained to us as we seek to attain Enlightenment. However, ultimately these arbitrary conceptions can be discarded.".17 A related line states: "Those who understand the dharma teaching as a raft should let go of dharmas, to say nothing of non-dharmas".2

This metaphor is significant for several reasons:

Skillful Means (Upāya): It exemplifies the Mahāyāna concept of upāya (skillful means), where teachings are understood as practical tools adapted to the needs of the practitioner, rather than as absolute truths in themselves.15
Non-Attachment to Dharma: It powerfully reinforces the theme of non-attachment, extending it even to the Buddha's own teachings. Clinging to the Dharma itself becomes an obstacle to liberation.2
Pragmatic Use of Language: It aligns with the interpretation that the Sutra aims to avoid ontological commitment to language while retaining its pragmatic value. The "raft" (Dharma/concepts) is useful for crossing the river (reaching enlightenment), but is not the destination itself.2
F. Non-Attainment (Chapters 7, 9, 17, etc.)
Throughout the Sutra, the Buddha and Subhuti engage in dialogues that negate the idea of attaining specific spiritual states or fruits.

In Chapter 7, Subhuti affirms that there is no fixed teaching the Buddha imparts, nor any definite "highest, most fulfilled, awakened or enlightened mind" to be attained.17 Enlightenment is presented as beyond fixed definition.
In Chapter 9, the Buddha questions Subhuti about whether a Stream-Enterer (Srotāpanna), Once-Returner (Sakṛdāgāmin), Non-Returner (Anāgāmin), or Arhat thinks they have attained the respective fruit of their stage. Subhuti consistently denies this, explaining that these are merely names and that clinging to the idea of attainment involves attachment to a self.84 Subhuti states that if he thought he had attained Arhatship, the Buddha would not have praised him for abiding peacefully in non-contention, because true non-contention involves abiding in nothing.167
This theme culminates in the idea of "cultivating without attainment".2
The significance includes:

Emptiness of Goals: It applies the principle of emptiness to the spiritual path itself, showing that stages and attainments lack inherent reality.
Avoiding Spiritual Materialism: It warns against turning enlightenment or spiritual stages into objects of craving or attachment, a form of "spiritual materialism".63
Focus on Process: It shifts the focus from achieving a future goal to the present practice of non-attachment and wisdom. True attainment lies in the realization that there is ultimately nothing to attain, as Buddha-nature is inherent.15
G. Merit of Upholding the Sutra (Multiple Chapters)
The Sutra repeatedly emphasizes the immense, inconceivable merit generated by receiving, retaining, reciting, understanding, and explaining even a four-line verse (gāthā) of the Diamond Sutra.2 This merit is consistently contrasted with, and declared far superior to, the merit gained from acts of material generosity, even on an astronomical scale (e.g., filling countless world-systems with jewels as gifts).16 However, this merit is also described paradoxically: "Such merits do not have the nature of merits, and for this reason the Tathāgata speaks of many merits".17

This emphasis signifies:

Primacy of Wisdom: It elevates the understanding and transmission of wisdom (prajñā) above material acts, positioning the Dharma itself as the highest gift.36
'Cult of the Book': This focus on the text itself contributed to the development of a "cult of the book" in Mahāyāna, where copying and reciting sutras became significant devotional practices for generating merit.32
Emptiness of Merit: The paradoxical statement about merit ("not a body of merit") reinforces the core theme – even the immense merit generated is ultimately empty of inherent existence and should not be clung to.15
H. The Mind That Abides Nowhere (Chapter 10)
A pivotal instruction is given in Chapter 10: "Therefore, Subhuti, bodhisattvas should relinquish all appearances and notions... They should not give rise to any thought attached to form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharma. They should give rise to a mind without any attachments. Any attachment of the mind is errant... They should give rise to a mind that is not dwelling anywhere.".16

This passage highlights:

Practice of Non-Abiding: It explicitly teaches the cultivation of a mind that does not fixate or "abide" (apratiṣṭha) on any object, concept, or mental state.1
Mental Freedom: This non-abiding mind is characterized by freedom, flexibility, and purity, unconstrained by attachments or preconceived notions.16
Chan/Zen Connection: This concept became a cornerstone of Chan/Zen practice and philosophy.41
I. Concluding Gatha (Chapter 32)
The Sutra concludes (in many versions) with a powerful four-line verse (gāthā) summarizing the illusory and impermanent nature of conditioned reality:

"All conditioned phenomena / Are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, or shadows; / Like drops of dew, or flashes of lightning; / Thusly should they be contemplated.".1 (Slight variations exist in translation, e.g., "As a lamp, a cataract, a star in space..." 18).

This concluding verse serves as:

A Poetic Summary: It offers a memorable and evocative encapsulation of the Sutra's teachings on impermanence (anitya) and the illusory nature of the phenomenal world.1
A Final Instruction: It provides a direct instruction on how practitioners should view their experience – recognizing its transient and dream-like quality.1
These key passages, interwoven throughout the Sutra, consistently reinforce the core themes of emptiness and non-attachment. The text employs a distinct pedagogical strategy using paradox, negation, and metaphor not merely to state philosophical positions, but to actively deconstruct the reader's habitual ways of thinking and perceiving. The emphasis remains consistently on the integration of profound wisdom (understanding emptiness) with compassionate practice (giving without attachment, liberating beings, cultivating a non-abiding mind).

IV. Historical Context and Influence
Understanding the Diamond Sutra requires situating it within its historical and literary context, tracing its origins, transmission, and profound impact on the development of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

A. Composition and Dating
The Diamond Sutra is a product of the Mahāyāna movement within Indian Buddhism, belonging to the Prajñāpāramitā (Perfection of Wisdom) genre of literature.1 This literature began to emerge perhaps as early as the 1st century BCE 19, possibly originating among Mahāsāṃghika communities in Southern India.81

The precise date of the Diamond Sutra's composition in Sanskrit remains uncertain, with scholarly estimates ranging broadly. Arguments have been made for dates between the 2nd and 5th centuries CE.2 Some scholars, particularly earlier ones like Edward Conze, placed it later within the Prajnaparamita development, possibly around the 4th century CE, viewing it as a summary of larger texts.19 However, other scholars, including some Japanese researchers and Gregory Schopen, propose an earlier date, potentially pre-dating the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra (Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 Lines), which is often considered the earliest major Prajnaparamita text.15 Arguments for an earlier date sometimes point to its focus on Subhuti (still seemingly learning the Mahayana path) compared to his more advanced role in the Aṣṭasāhasrikā 49, its lack of explicit Mahāyāna terminology 15, and a perceived shift from oral (Vajracchedikā) to written (Aṣṭasāhasrikā) emphasis.81 The existence of authoritative commentaries by the 4th-5th century Indian masters Asaṅga and Vasubandhu suggests the Sutra was already considered important by that time.2

B. Transmission and Translation
Originating in India, the Diamond Sutra spread widely across Central and East Asia, evidenced by early translations into numerous languages.1 Surviving manuscripts in Sanskrit, Khotanese, Sogdian, Uighur, Tibetan, and Chinese attest to its broad geographical reach and study.2

The most influential translation was the Chinese version by the Kuchean monk Kumārajīva (鳩摩羅什, 344–413 CE), completed around 401-402 CE.1 Kumārajīva's translation is renowned for its flowing style and emphasis on conveying meaning rather than strict literalism, making it highly readable and accessible.2 It is this version that appears on the 868 CE Dunhuang scroll and remains the most widely used and chanted version in East Asia
