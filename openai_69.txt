Differences and Connections between Google’s A2A Protocol and MCP Across Domains
Introduction
Google’s recently released A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol – often mistakenly expanded as “Account-to-Account” in financial contexts – is an open specification for autonomous AI agents to communicate and collaborate directly with each other ([Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@shamim_ru/google-agent-to-agent-a2a-protocol-explained-with-real-working-examples-99e362b61ba8#:~:text=In summary%2C the A2A protocol,their conversation along the way)) ([

Debuting in 2025 with broad industry support, A2A aims to standardize how independent agents (AI services, bots, or processes) securely exchange tasks and data over the web. On the other hand, **MCP** is an acronym that can refer to several different protocols depending on the domain. Notable interpretations include: 
Model Context Protocol (MCP) – an open AI-centric protocol (introduced by Anthropic) that standardizes how AI models connect to external tools and data sources ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Think of MCP as “plug,”)) ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol ,database rows%2C or API handles)). This is the relevant MCP in the AI/agent domain and is complementary to A2A.
Mobile Content Protocol (MCP) – a term sometimes used for mobile content delivery or interaction protocols. (This is not a standardized global protocol and is unrelated to Google’s A2A.)
Media Control Protocol (MCP) – a telecommunications protocol for media streaming/control, for example controlling media servers in call setups ([TS 103 269-2 - V1.1.1 - TETRA and Critical Communications Evolution (TCCE); Critical Communications Architecture; Part 2: Critical Communications application mobile to network interface architecture](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/10326902/01.01.01_60/ts_10326902v010101p.pdf#:~:text=establishment phase,The calling party)). This is a separate domain (telecom/media) with no relation to Google’s A2A agent communication.
Multi-Channel Protocol (MCP) – a generic term that can describe networking protocols using multiple channels (e.g. multi-channel MAC in wireless networks). Again, this shares the acronym but is unrelated in purpose to A2A.
In this report, we focus on Google’s A2A protocol and the Model Context Protocol (Anthropic’s MCP) – comparing their technical architecture, security, performance, and use-cases – since these two belong to the AI agent domain and have direct connections. We also clarify how A2A differs from the other MCP variants in other domains. Key differences and relationships are summarized below, followed by detailed sections.

Each agent runs an A2A server (exposing an API) and communicates via an A2A client in another agent (Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium) (Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium). Agents advertise capabilities through an Agent Card (a .well-known/agent.json descriptor) for discovery (Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium). | Client–Server tool access: An AI host (agent or LLM) connects to one or more MCP servers (lightweight services) via an MCP client/SDK (Introduction - Model Context Protocol). Each MCP server exposes a specific tool or data source through a standardized interface. Typically runs locally or in-network (within a VPC or on the user’s machine) to provide the model with controlled access to files, databases, APIs, etc. ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io#:~:text=

Each agent can verify and trust requests via tokens/credentials. Built-in authentication is part of the protocol design (Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium). Communication is over HTTPS for encryption. Fine-grained permission possible per skill/task. | Secure tool sandboxing: MCP is designed to keep data access within the owner’s infrastructure (Introduction - Model Context Protocol). The model/agent doesn’t get raw credentials; it must go through the MCP server which enforces access controls. Connections can be restricted to local network or secured channels. The emphasis is on not exposing sensitive data directly to the LLM, but rather streaming it through a governed interface. (Anthropic provides best-practice guidelines for securing MCP servers in enterprise use.) |

| Performance | Network overhead since agents may be distributed across systems. Uses lightweight JSON messages (JSON-RPC 2.0) to minimize overhead ([Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@shamim_ru/google-agent-to-agent-a2a-protocol-explained-with-real-working-examples-99e362b61ba8#:~:text=Good Parts of the A2A,Protocol)).

The protocol is optimized for data exchange with tools (e.g. sending a file chunk or database query result). Because it’s typically not going over the public internet for each call, latency is low. However, it’s not meant for high-throughput streaming to remote clients – it’s focused on the model’s context needs. |

| Supported Modalities | Supports multimodal content between agents (text, audio, video streams, images, etc.) – not limited to text ([

Agents negotiate what formats they can handle (“user experience negotiation”) so, for example, an agent can send an image or stream audio if the other agent supports it. Designed for long-running interactions (agents maintain dialog with incremental updates). | Supports exchanging structured data and files. For example, an MCP file-system server can send text content of a file or an image in binary to the AI. It’s primarily about providing contextual data (which could include text, documents, etc.) and receiving commands. MCP itself doesn’t generate content; it relays data. So modalities depend on what servers are available (one could imagine an MCP server for images or audio input to the model, etc., but it’s mostly about data and tool results). |

| Use Cases | Agent collaboration: Orchestrating complex workflows with multiple agents (potentially from different providers) working together ([

For example, an HR agent, a finance agent, and a scheduling agent coordinating to automate a hiring process in an enterprise. Another example is an **agent-based payment flow**, where service agents broker a payment with cryptographic proofs via A2A messages ([Google's A2A Protocol - Payments](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/googles-a2a-protocol-payments-maksym-khudiakov-ol9he#:~:text=In%20this%20agent,Check%20%28Step%203)) ([Google's A2A Protocol - Payments](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/googles-a2a-protocol-payments-maksym-khudiakov-ol9he#:~:text=Upon%20validation%2C%20the%20Payment%20Provider,cryptographic%20signatures%20and%20envelope%20chaining)). Essentially, **A2A treats each agent as a peer service** that can delegate tasks to others or ask for information. | **Tool/Resource augmentation:** Allowing an AI agent or assistant to use external utilities: e.g. retrieving information from a database, performing a web search, reading files, or invoking an API. For example, an LLM-based assistant could query a vector database via an MCP vector-index server, or fetch weather via an MCP web API server. **MCP makes the model *not* just an isolated intelligence, but one augmented with plugins/tools** in a standardized way ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Anthropic%E2%80%99s%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20,database%20rows%2C%20or%20API%20handles)). (It solves the “single-agent with tools” problem, whereas A2A tackles the multi-agent interaction problem ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Think%20of%20MCP%20as%20%E2%80%9Cplug,%E2%80%9D)) ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Where%20A2A%20and%20MCP%20meet)).) |
| Relation to Each Other | Complementary: A2A and MCP address different layers. A2A focuses on agent-to-agent interoperability, while MCP focuses on agent-to-tool connectivity ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Where A2A and MCP meet)). They can be used together – e.g. an A2A agent might internally use MCP to perform tasks, advertising those capabilities to other agents. Google’s A2A spec explicitly supports MCP integration (agents can list MCP-based skills in their Agent Card) (Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)). In practice, MCP can run “inside” an agent, and A2A connects the agent to others externally ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Bridge to MCP)). | No conflict: They serve different purposes and can interoperate. Anthropic’s and Google’s efforts are aligned – Google describes A2A as complementing Anthropic’s MCP ([

Neither replaces the other. In analogy: MCP is like giving an agent **tools and knowledge**, and A2A is like giving agents a **telephone line to each other**. Together, they enable a multi-agent system where each agent is both well-equipped and well-connected ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Think%20of%20MCP%20as%20%E2%80%9Cplug,yet%20another%20bespoke%20JSON%20dialect)) ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=match%20at%20L233%20MCP%20let,feels%20familiar%3A%20REST%20and%20WebSockets)). |
(Note: Other protocols named “MCP” – Mobile Content, Media Control, Multi-Channel – are omitted from the table because they operate in entirely different contexts, e.g. telecom or networking, and do not overlap with A2A. They share an acronym but have no functional connection to Google’s A2A or Anthropic’s MCP.)

Technical Architecture and Security
A2A Architecture: Google’s A2A defines a standard message-passing architecture over HTTP for autonomous agents. It is built on familiar web technologies – specifically HTTP REST endpoints with JSON-RPC 2.0 payloads and Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates ([



        Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)

    ](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/#:~:text=,stacks%20businesses%20already%20use%20daily)). Every agent running A2A exposes itself as an **A2A server** (an HTTP API following the A2A spec) and can act as an **A2A client** to other agents ([Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@shamim_ru/google-agent-to-agent-a2a-protocol-explained-with-real-working-examples-99e362b61ba8#:~:text=A2A%20Server)). To enable **discovery and interoperability**, each agent hosts an **Agent Card** (a JSON file in a well-known location) advertising its name, capabilities (“skills”), endpoint URL, and supported authentication methods ([Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@shamim_ru/google-agent-to-agent-a2a-protocol-explained-with-real-working-examples-99e362b61ba8#:~:text=Every%20agent%20has%20a%20public,known%2Fagent.json%60%29%20that%20tells%20the%20world)). This allows agents to find each other and understand how to communicate securely. When one agent (the *client agent*) wants to delegate a task, it will look up the target agent’s card to see what it can do and how to call it. The client then sends a JSON-RPC request to the remote agent’s HTTP endpoint, carrying a **Task** (which includes an ID, action/skill name, parameters, etc.). The protocol defines a lifecycle for tasks – e.g. *submitted*, *working*, *input-required* (if the agent needs more info), *completed*, *failed*, etc. ([Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@shamim_ru/google-agent-to-agent-a2a-protocol-explained-with-real-working-examples-99e362b61ba8#:~:text=Task)) ([Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@shamim_ru/google-agent-to-agent-a2a-protocol-explained-with-real-working-examples-99e362b61ba8#:~:text=Message)) – and this state is tracked so that complex, long-running jobs can be managed in a standardized way.
Importantly, A2A was designed with enterprise integration in mind. It does not reinvent the wheel but builds on proven standards like HTTP and JSON, meaning it can easily ride over existing network infrastructure and work with enterprise auth systems ([

    ](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/#:~:text=,stacks%20businesses%20already%20use%20daily)). The protocol is *framework-agnostic*: as long as an agent implements the A2A API and produces/consumes the expected JSON message schema, it can be built in any language or AI framework. This architecture addresses the challenge of connecting “opaque” AI agents (possibly black-box LLM systems) that don’t share memory or a common runtime ([
        
        Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)
        
        
        - Google Developers Blog
        
    ](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)). Instead of trying to merge them in one process, A2A links them **over the network with a common language**. The use of SSE (or WebSockets in some implementations) allows the remote agent to push incremental results or messages back to the client agent, which is crucial for interactive or long tasks (so the client isn’t left polling). In summary, A2A’s architecture enables **distributed, heterogeneous AI services to function as a team** through a clear web-based protocol.
MCP Architecture (Model Context Protocol): Anthropic’s MCP, by contrast, is about connecting an AI model/agent to local resources rather than connecting two independent agents. Its architecture follows a client-server model as well, but typically within a single user’s environment. An MCP server is a lightweight service that exposes some capability – for example, “file system access” or “SQL database query” – through a standardized API (MCP defines a schema for requests and responses). An MCP client/host (often part of the AI application) maintains a connection to this server ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/#:~:text=,MCP servers can connect to)). When the AI needs to use a tool, it sends a request (via the MCP client) to the appropriate server, which executes the action (e.g. read a file, or run a query) and returns the result. The general idea is to provide context or perform actions on behalf of the AI in a controlled way. For instance, rather than giving an LLM direct filesystem access, you would run an MCP file-server that the LLM can query like “read file X” – the server reads the file and streams back the content. The MCP protocol standardizes the format of these requests and responses, so that an AI developer can plug in any number of tools easily ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol ,database rows%2C or API handles)). It’s analogous to a plugin system or a “universal port” for tools. Technically, MCP uses structured JSON (often over HTTP or a socket) as well, and many SDKs exist (Python, TypeScript, etc.) to implement the client or server side ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/#:~:text=URL%3A

Security in A2A: Since A2A is meant for cross-agent and cross-organization communication, security is paramount. The protocol was built to be “secure by default,” incorporating authentication and authorization similar to what is used in RESTful APIs for enterprise. In fact, A2A supports the same auth schemes as OpenAPI/Swagger – meaning an agent can require an OAuth 2.0 bearer token, API key, etc., and this will be described in its Agent Card ([



        Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)
        
        
        - Google Developers Blog
        
    ](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/#:~:text=integrate%20with%20existing%20IT%20stacks,businesses%20already%20use%20daily)). For example, an agent might list that it uses JWT bearer tokens signed by a certain authority; a calling agent would then obtain or present an appropriate token. This parity with established web auth standards makes it easier to integrate A2A into existing identity systems (e.g. using service accounts or user identity delegation). Additionally, messages between agents are transmitted over TLS (HTTPS), so communication is encrypted in transit. Each **task request can carry the identity of the requester** (the protocol allows including an “invoker” field or similar in the JSON-RPC context). This can be used for audit logging or access control – an agent might decide to reject a request if the requesting agent (or the end-user it represents) is not authorized for that action. Because agents may be executing potentially sensitive operations on each other’s behalf, this built-in trust mechanism is critical. As one source notes, the A2A approach ensures **secure interactions from the ground up via built-in authentication** ([Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@shamim_ru/google-agent-to-agent-a2a-protocol-explained-with-real-working-examples-99e362b61ba8#:~:text=%2A%20Built,based%20systems%20and%20tooling)). Moreover, A2A’s design anticipates enterprise needs like **policy control** and **governance**: since all interactions are API-driven, enterprises can apply API management techniques (rate limiting, monitoring, logging) to agent communications just as they do for microservices.
Security in MCP: The Model Context Protocol’s security model is about safely bridging AI to data. The guiding principle is least privilege and data locality. The AI model does not get unfettered access to tools; it can only perform what the MCP servers expose. For instance, if there’s an MCP server that allows running SQL queries on a database, it might be configured to only allow read queries on certain tables. The AI would send a query through MCP, and the server would validate and execute it – the model itself never directly touches the database or credentials. This setup helps prevent an AI from doing unintended harm, because the server can enforce rules (e.g. no file writes, or limit to certain directories). Also, because MCP servers are typically run by the user or enterprise within their own secure environment (e.g. on a user’s PC for Claude Desktop, or on a company’s cloud for an AI service) ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/#:~:text=,MCP servers can connect to)), sensitive data does not leave the trusted boundary. Only the results and necessary context are shared with the model. That said, authentication is still relevant: an MCP client (the AI host) needs to authenticate with each MCP server it uses. In practice, local MCP servers might use simple tokens or OS-level permissions for authentication, whereas remote MCP servers (if any) could use API keys or OAuth. The MCP spec is open about allowing any secure transport – it could be local function calls, HTTP on localhost, or even HTTPS calls to a remote service – so long as the protocol format is followed. Anthropic provides recommendations for securing these channels (for example, running all MCP traffic in a VPC or over localhost, to minimize exposure) ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=match at L168 ,run inside the same VPC)). In summary, MCP’s security is less about authenticating external third-parties (since usually the AI and the tool are controlled by the same entity) and more about containing what the AI can do and keeping the data flow governed.

Comparison: Both A2A and MCP put a strong emphasis on security but at different layers. A2A creates a trust fabric between agents, often across organizations, so it focuses on mutual authentication, data encryption, and permission management between services ([

MCP creates a trust interface *between an agent and its tools*, focusing on **safe data exchange and preventing unintended actions** within one organization’s environment. It’s worth noting that **neither A2A nor MCP (in their current forms) handle *financial value transfer or user identity verification* out-of-the-box** – their scope is communication and invocation, not payments or identity federation ([Google's A2A Protocol - Payments](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/googles-a2a-protocol-payments-maksym-khudiakov-ol9he#:~:text=Neither%20A2A%20nor%20MCP%20currently,verifiable%20value%20exchange%20between%20agents)). For example, A2A doesn’t implement a cryptocurrency or banking transfer itself; instead, one would need to build a payment protocol on top of A2A (as some have proposed) if agents are to exchange money or credentials. We will discuss this more in later sections about use cases and gaps.
Intended Use Cases and Functional Differences
A2A Use Cases and Features: A2A is fundamentally about enabling complex, multi-agent workflows. Its use cases involve scenarios where you have multiple AI-driven agents or services that need to cooperate. For instance, in an enterprise, you might have one agent specialized in CRM data, another specialized in finance, and another in scheduling; using A2A, a high-level orchestration agent could delegate sub-tasks to each of these specialized agents and aggregate the results. Because A2A provides a uniform way to represent tasks and track their state, it simplifies building such orchestrations without custom glue code for each pair of agents. Key features that support these use cases include:

Dynamic Capability Discovery: Through the Agent Card registry, agents can find out what other agents can do at runtime ([Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@shamim_ru/google-agent-to-agent-a2a-protocol-explained-with-real-working-examples-99e362b61ba8#:~:text=Every agent has a public,known%2Fagent.json`) that tells the world)). This is useful in open environments (like a marketplace of agents or enterprise service registry) – an agent can say “who can translate text?” and find a translation agent, for example. This dynamic discovery is a new capability that wasn’t present when each AI system was a silo.
Task Delegation and Chaining: An agent can offload a sub-task (e.g. “generate a monthly report”) to another agent that has that skill. That agent in turn could call others (e.g. one to pull data, another to format a document). A2A handles the choreography of these calls – each task has an ID and state, and agents can pass around references to tasks or results. The protocol defines how agents coordinate these tasks and subtasks so that nothing is lost or duplicated.
Multi-Modal and Long-Running Sessions: A2A agents can maintain a conversation or session over multiple turns, including sending binary data if needed (for instance, an agent could ask another for an image, or stream audio). The support for modalities beyond text means A2A isn’t limited to chatbots – it could connect agents in robotics (sending sensor data), or agents in media (sending video for analysis), etc. ([

  ](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/#:~:text=,including%20audio%20and%20video%20streaming)). Also, the long-running task support allows use cases like research agents that work for hours and report intermediate progress ([

This is critical in workflows like legal document processing or data analysis, where one agent might be crunching data for a long time and the initiating agent (or a human user) needs periodic updates.  
Enterprise Automation: One explicit goal of A2A is to make it easier to integrate AI agents into enterprise systems ([Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://google.github.io/A2A#:~:text=addressing the current lack of,agent interoperability)). For example, consider identity verification: a user might upload documents to one agent that specializes in OCR and fraud detection, which then needs to inform another agent that manages user accounts. With A2A, these agents can talk directly in a standardized way, rather than requiring a human or custom code to bridge them. Similarly, in IT workflows, an incident response agent could collaborate with a monitoring agent and a remediation agent to automatically handle outages. These kinds of multi-agent automations are facilitated by A2A’s common language and security model, which were lacking when every AI or bot had a proprietary API.
One illustrative use case presented in community discussions is agent-mediated payments ([Google's A2A Protocol - Payments](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/googles-a2a-protocol-payments-maksym-khudiakov-ol9he#:~:text=In this agent,Check (Step 3)). While A2A itself doesn’t move money, one can use A2A to coordinate a payment between multiple parties: imagine a Service Provider agent requesting payment, a Broker agent adding its fee, and an End User agent that approves and signs an e-check, all passing the information along via A2A messages ([Google's A2A Protocol - Payments](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/googles-a2a-protocol-payments-maksym-khudiakov-ol9he#:~:text=In

In summary, the functional scope of A2A is agent interoperability: it provides the features needed for agents to find each other, negotiate how to work together, exchange information, and jointly perform tasks securely ([Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://google.github.io/A2A#:~:text=,current lack of agent interoperability)). It is not limited to any one domain – it could be used for finance, healthcare, IT, customer service, etc., wherever agent cooperation is beneficial. It also intentionally leaves certain functions (like monetary transfer, human-readable UI, etc.) to other layers, focusing purely on the agent communication aspect.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) Use Cases and Features: MCP’s functionality is different; it’s aimed at solving the problem of “how can an AI model use tools or data that are outside its own neural network?” Typical use cases for MCP include:

Data Retrieval: An AI assistant answering a question might need to pull information from a company database or an internal knowledge base. With MCP, a developer can spin up an MCP server connected to that database; the AI can then send queries (in natural language or a query language) to that server to get the data. The MCP protocol ensures the query and result are in a format the AI can handle, and the context (result) can be inserted into the model’s prompt or memory.
File Operations and Local Resources: For tools like Claude Desktop (Anthropic’s local AI app), MCP allows the AI to read or write files on the user’s computer (with permission) ([Model Context Protocol (MCP) - Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp#:~:text=MCP Documentation Learn more about,to your computer’s file system)). For example, the user could ask the AI “summarize this PDF” – behind the scenes Claude uses MCP to ask a “file system server” to open and stream the PDF content. The benefit is that Claude doesn’t need PDF parsing logic built-in; any MCP-compliant file server that knows how to handle PDFs can serve multiple AI apps. This modular approach is akin to the plugin systems of other AI (OpenAI functions, etc.), but MCP formalizes it in an open standard.
External API Calls and Services: MCP servers can act as proxies to external web services. You might have an MCP server for a weather API, or for a stock price API. The AI can then say (in effect) “weather_server.get_weather(location)” via MCP and get a structured response. In early AI “agent” frameworks, developers often hard-coded such tool use; with MCP, there’s a uniform interface and potentially interchangeable tools. If you don’t like one weather MCP server, you could swap it out with another, as long as both adhere to the MCP spec for a “weather” capability. This interoperability of tools is similar in spirit to A2A’s interoperability of agents – both aim to avoid lock-in to a specific vendor’s format.
Secure Environment Bridging: Some use cases involve keeping certain operations isolated. For instance, an enterprise might have an LLM running in the cloud but it needs to access an on-premise data source. They could run an MCP server on-prem that the cloud agent can reach through a secure channel. This way, they expose minimal surface (the MCP interface, with all necessary checks) instead of the entire database or system. MCP’s design (small, focused servers for each resource) makes it easier to compartmentalize access. Each server only does one kind of task, and the AI only talks to that entry point. So, functionally, MCP is providing the AI controlled “superpowers” – like reading files, running code, sending emails, etc. – but each is a constrained capability.
In essence, MCP’s functional role is akin to that of a “plugin” or “tool use” protocol for AI. It covers what the AI itself cannot intrinsically do by language alone. A2A, by contrast, is about how multiple AI entities talk to each other. One can see that these are complementary: an AI agent might use MCP to accomplish a sub-task (like calling an API) and then use A2A to convey the result to another agent or ask another agent for help.

To avoid confusion: the other MCPs in other domains have completely different functions. For example, a Media Control Protocol in telecom is used to manage call media streams (allocating channels, indicating when to start sending audio, etc.) ([TS 103 269-2 - V1.1.1 - TETRA and Critical Communications Evolution (TCCE); Critical Communications Architecture; Part 2: Critical Communications application mobile to network interface architecture](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/10326902/01.01.01_60/ts_10326902v010101p.pdf#:~:text=establishment phase,The calling party)) – this is a low-level real-time control use case, nothing to do with AI or data integration. A Mobile Content Protocol would be about delivering content (news, ringtones, etc.) to mobile devices – again unrelated to AI agent interactions or tool use. So, when discussing features and use cases, it’s clear that Google’s A2A and Anthropic’s Model Context MCP share a common domain (AI systems) but target different problems within that domain, whereas other “MCP” protocols are entirely separate solutions for separate problems.

Overlaps and Complementarity between A2A and MCP
Given that A2A and the Model Context Protocol were developed around the same time in the AI community, an obvious question is how they relate. Do they overlap? Are they competing standards, or do they fit together? The answer, emphasized by both Google and Anthropic, is that they are complementary and serve different layers of the AI ecosystem ([

No Direct Redundancy: A2A does not replace the need for tool integration, and MCP does not enable multi-agent communication by itself. A2A assumes that each agent it connects to is a capable service. How that agent gets its capabilities (whether via internal logic or via MCP-connected tools) is outside A2A’s scope. Conversely, MCP makes one agent more powerful by giving it access to tools, but if you only have one agent in isolation, MCP doesn’t magically connect it to other agents – that’s where A2A would be needed if you introduce a second agent. So there is no conflict in using both; in fact, they were explicitly designed to complement. Google’s A2A announcement states that “A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents” ([

Integration of MCP into A2A Agents: In practical architecture, one can use MCP inside an A2A agent. For example, suppose you have an agent that is a “Research Assistant” which can answer questions by doing web searches and reading documents. Internally, this agent could use MCP: an MCP server for web search, an MCP server for PDF reading, etc. Externally, you register the agent in A2A with skills like “answer_question”. In the Agent Card for this agent, you might list that it has a skill “WebSearch” and “PDFReader” and these are implemented via MCP (the A2A spec allows advertising that the agent supports certain MCP tool interfaces) (Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)). Now, if another agent asks the Research Assistant a question via A2A, the Assistant behind the scenes will call its MCP tools to gather info, then return the answer over A2A. This shows how one protocol leverages the other. In fact, the Google A2A documentation explicitly encourages this kind of layering: “Inside your agent process, mount local tools as MCP servers…and advertise those skills in your Agent Card. Now external agents can first negotiate via A2A, then tunnel calls via MCP without hard-coding integration details.” ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Bridge to MCP)). In simpler terms, A2A handles the *agent-to-agent handshake* and high-level task passing, while MCP handles *agent-to-resource interactions* as a second step ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Where A2A and MCP meet)).
Combined Use Case Example: Consider a multi-agent system where Agent A is an Invoice Processor and Agent B is a Finance Database agent. Agent A’s job is to take an invoice (maybe a PDF) and enter data into the finance system; Agent B’s job is to fetch data from a finance database given a query. Using both protocols: Agent A might receive a PDF (maybe from a user or another agent), and it uses an MCP OCR tool to extract text from the PDF (this is agent-to-tool via MCP). Now Agent A wants to get the vendor details from the finance DB, so it uses A2A to ask Agent B “get vendor info for XYZ Corp”. Agent B in turn might use its own MCP database connector to run the query on the internal database, then it returns the result to Agent A via A2A. Finally, Agent A uses another MCP tool to input the data into a form or system. In this chain, MCP was used within each agent to interface with specific data/software, and A2A was used between Agent A and Agent B to coordinate the overall task. Such compositions are key to building sophisticated AI workflows, and they demonstrate the modularity introduced by these protocols.
Overlaps in Philosophy, not Function: One area of “overlap” is that both protocols are striving to create standardization and interoperability in the AI space. They share a similar philosophy of openness and vendor-neutral design. A2A is openly published by Google and involves many partners; MCP is open-sourced by Anthropic and designed for any AI to use. Both use JSON and web technologies. Both aim to prevent a proliferation of incompatible “dialects” of agent communication or tool APIs. As one engineer quipped, using A2A and MCP together lets you “compose rich, multi-agent systems without inventing yet another bespoke JSON dialect.” ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Think of MCP as “plug,yet another bespoke JSON dialect)) This is a dig at how, before these standards, many developers were hand-rolling JSON protocols for their AI agents to talk to tools or each other. Now A2A and MCP provide off-the-shelf standards. So, while A2A and MCP don’t overlap in feature set, they do align in their goals of standardizing AI interactions.
MCP in Other Domains: For completeness, note that the other MCP variants (Mobile Content, Media Control, etc.) have no complementarity with A2A – they simply solve unrelated problems. There is neither overlap nor integration between A2A and, say, a media streaming control protocol; they would typically never coexist in the same system. At most, if an agent needed to control a media server, one might write an MCP server that speaks the media control protocol to the server, thus indirectly involving both – but that’s stretching the scenario. In general, when discussing overlap, we are talking about A2A and Model Context Protocol only.
In conclusion, A2A + MCP (Model Context) together offer a more complete ecosystem: A2A networks AI agents together, and MCP plugs each agent into tools/data. Google’s and Anthropic’s approaches were developed to be complementary building blocks rather than competing ones ([

Innovative Features and Improvements of Google’s A2A
Google’s A2A protocol introduced several innovative features and design choices, intended to advance beyond existing practices for agent communication. Here are some of the notable aspects of A2A, along with the problems they address or improvements they offer over prior approaches:

Open Standard with Broad Support: A2A was launched as an open protocol with contributions from over 50 technology partners, including major software companies and enterprise service providers ([


      Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)

  ](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20launching%20a%20new%2C,service%20providers%20including%20Accenture%2C%20BCG)). This level of collaboration is itself an innovation – instead of a single-vendor API, it’s a community-driven spec. The aim is to avoid fragmentation: if many players adopt A2A, agents from different vendors will natively speak a common language. This is a big improvement over earlier “agents” (or chatbots) which often could not directly interact, or used one-off integrations. The openness also means anyone can implement A2A without licensing, encouraging a wide ecosystem of compatible agents and development kits.
Agent Card and Discovery Mechanism: The concept of the Agent Card is a new introduction that simplifies interoperability. By having a standard metadata file that any agent can host, A2A creates a web of discoverable agents. This is akin to how web services might publish an OpenAPI spec, but tailored for AI agent capabilities. The Agent Card includes not just API endpoint info but a description of skills the agent offers ([Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@shamim_ru/google-agent-to-agent-a2a-protocol-explained-with-real-working-examples-99e362b61ba8#:~:text=Every agent has a public,known%2Fagent.json`) that tells the world)). This is innovative because it moves towards a world where agents can find each other and understand each other’s “intents” without manual configuration. It lays groundwork for agent directories or marketplaces, where a software system could automatically pick an appropriate agent for a task by reading Agent Cards. In prior systems, integration was often manual – you had to know the API of the other service in advance and code against it. A2A’s discovery reduces that friction significantly.
JSON-RPC Based Messaging: A2A uses JSON-RPC 2.0, a lightweight RPC protocol using JSON. This choice is notable because JSON-RPC is simple yet expressive (supports requests, responses, and even method namespaces), and is not tied to any one programming language. Many past approaches to agent communication might have used raw REST (each action as a separate URL) or even custom JSON formats. By using JSON-RPC, A2A gets a standard envelope and error handling format for free, and it keeps all interactions under a single HTTP endpoint per agent. The advantage is both in interoperability and in development speed (lots of JSON-RPC libraries exist). It also supports notifications (one-way messages) and batched calls if needed, which can be useful for agent scenarios. This design decision shows an improvement in terms of using a proven tech to avoid reinventing messaging.
Built-In Authentication & Authorization Hooks: As discussed, A2A built security into the protocol from day one. The Agent Card can specify auth requirements, and the protocol expects agents to enforce auth on each request. This is an improvement over the early days of “agent APIs” or bot integrations which often were hacked together without strong auth, or relied on network isolation. By having parity with OpenAPI auth schemes ([

This addresses the problem of organizations being wary to let one agent call another – with A2A, they can require the same tokens/credentials they would for any API. It simplifies trust management: for example, if an agent represents a user, it could attach the user’s OAuth token when calling a service agent, just as if the user called a REST API. The innovation here is making this a **standard part of the protocol** rather than an afterthought.
Task Management and Long-Running Task Support: A2A’s protocol includes the notion of task state and the ability for an agent to signal partial completion, request more input, or stream outputs. This is an architectural improvement acknowledging that many AI tasks won’t be single-turn or instantaneous. For example, if an agent needs the user to clarify something, it can send back an “input-required” state, effectively pausing the task until more info is given ([Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@shamim_ru/google-agent-to-agent-a2a-protocol-explained-with-real-working-examples-99e362b61ba8#:~:text=,wrong or it was stopped)). This is akin to a workflow engine but generalized to agents. Long-running support (tasks that could last minutes or hours) is built in ([​ Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)​ ​

  - Google Developers Blog
](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/#:~:text=%2A%20Support%20for%20long,state%20updates%20to%20its%20users)), meaning agents won’t timeout or break if something takes a while – they can keep the connection open or use callbacks/notifications to update later. In older systems, if a backend took too long, you might just hit an HTTP timeout. A2A provides a more graceful way to handle extended processes, which is crucial when you have humans or multiple AI steps in the loop. This is an innovative step toward asynchronous, resilient AI workflows.
Multimodal and Flexible Content Handling: As mentioned, A2A isn’t limited to plain text. The protocol supports sending “parts” in messages that could be different media or structured data (Google Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Explained — with Real Working Examples | by Shamim Bhuiyan | Apr, 2025 | Medium). This is forward-looking since AI agents are increasingly dealing with images, audio (think voice agents), or other data (like JSON results). By not restricting content, A2A improves over many chatbot APIs that only handled text. It effectively future-proofs the protocol for things like an agent that can generate an image and send it to another agent for analysis, or a voice assistant agent interacting with a speech-to-text agent. The modalities are negotiated or known via Agent Card, so agents can avoid media they don’t support.
Enterprise Features – Negotiation and Push: Google highlighted “user experience negotiation” and things like “push notifications” as key features ([Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://google.github.io/A2A#:~:text=,Open standards for connecting Agents)) ([Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://google.github.io/A2A#:~:text=​ Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)​ ​

  - Google Developers Blog
](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/#:~:text=%2A%20Support%20for%20long,state%20updates%20to%20its%20users)).
Composable with Other Standards: A2A’s design deliberately complements other standards like MCP (as we covered) and even things like OpenAPI. Rather than trying to include tool use, it relies on MCP; rather than inventing a new auth or new data format, it uses existing ones (OAuth, JSON). This composability is an innovative stance because it acknowledges the ecosystem – it’s a protocol that plays well with others. It can ride on top of existing web infrastructure and can be adopted incrementally (you could start using A2A between two agents while others remain legacy). One source noted that since “A2A is just HTTP,” one can adopt it progressively without uprooting everything ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Now external agents can first,MCP without hard‑coding integration details)). This incremental adoption path is crucial for real-world use (companies can pilot A2A in part of their system, then expand), making it more likely to succeed where more monolithic solutions fail.
Community-Driven Roadmap: Google released A2A as a work-in-progress with a public GitHub and is soliciting community feedback ([Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://google.github.io/A2A#:~:text=A2A is a work in,0 and maintain stable releases)). This approach is somewhat novel in the AI agent space – to develop the standard in the open, potentially evolving quickly based on real use cases. The rapid iteration and openness are themselves an improvement over slow-moving standards or closed implementations.
In short, A2A’s innovations target the pain points that early AI integration efforts faced: lack of interoperability, ad-hoc security, inability to handle long or complex sequences, and difficulty integrating into existing tech stacks. By addressing these, A2A sets a foundation for more scalable and maintainable AI-driven systems. It turns the concept of “agents that talk to each other” from a research demo into an enterprise-ready reality, similar to how standard APIs made distributed computing feasible.

Problems and Inefficiencies Addressed by A2A
Finally, it’s important to highlight what specific problems A2A was built to solve in current digital ecosystems – including payments, identity, and authentication scenarios. Many of these problems were touched upon above, but here we summarize them explicitly:

Lack of Interoperability (Agent Silos): Before A2A, if you had two AI systems, there was no standard way for them to communicate. This led to “agent silos,” where each AI could only operate on its own or required a custom integration to work with another. In practice, this meant organizations couldn’t easily mix AI services (e.g., using one company’s chatbot with another’s analytics agent). A2A directly addresses this by offering a lingua franca for agents, eliminating the need for one-off adapters. As Google noted, it “addresses the current lack of agent interoperability” by allowing agents built on different frameworks or by different vendors to collaborate ([Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://google.github.io/A2A#:~:text=,current lack of agent interoperability)). This improves efficiency because companies can leverage the best agents for each job and have them coordinate, rather than being stuck with a monolithic system.
Integration Overhead and Custom Protocols: Relatedly, without A2A each integration was essentially reinventing a protocol. Developers wasted time designing how to pass messages, what format to use, how to do auth, etc., for every pair of systems. This was inefficient and error-prone. A2A provides a pre-defined structure (tasks, messages, agent discovery) so that integration overhead is vastly reduced. You don’t have to design a conversation format for agents – it’s given by A2A. As one source quipped, A2A and MCP prevent the need to create “bespoke JSON dialects” for each integration ([Agent to agent, not tool to tool: an engineer’s guide to Google’s A2A protocol — WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/engineers-guide-to-googles-a2a-protocol#:~:text=Think of MCP as “plug,yet another bespoke JSON dialect)). This standardization speeds up development and reduces bugs or security flaws that could arise in homebrew protocols.
Security and Trust in Automation: In many digital ecosystems (especially finance or identity), a huge barrier to automation is trust. For example, a bank might be nervous to let an automated agent initiate transfers or share customer data with another agent, because of security concerns. A2A tackles this by embedding modern security (auth, encryption) into the framework, thus raising the trust level. It’s easier to trust an agent-to-agent interaction when you know it uses signed tokens and can be audited like any API call. In identity scenarios, this is crucial – e.g., if an “Identity Verification Agent” is talking to a “Service## Problems and Inefficiencies A2A Addresses
Finally, it’s important to highlight what specific problems A2A was built to solve in current digital ecosystems – including payments, identity, and authentication scenarios. Many of these issues were touched on above, but here they are summarized explicitly:

Siloed AI Services & Lack of Interoperability: Before A2A, AI or automation services couldn’t easily talk to each other. Enterprises ended up with siloed “intelligent” systems that a human or custom integrator had to coordinate. This is inefficient and doesn’t scale. A2A addresses this by allowing direct agent-to-agent interoperability across different systems. Google specifically noted the “current lack of agent interoperability” and how A2A lets agents work across the entire enterprise stack ([Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://google.github.io/A2A#:~:text=,current lack of agent interoperability)) ([​ Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)​ ​

  - Google Developers Blog
](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/#:~:text=Wipro,their%20entire%20enterprise%20application%20estates)). In practical terms, this means if one department builds an AI agent and another department builds a different agent, they can collaborate without needing to build a brand-new integration for each pair of agents. This greatly reduces the time and cost to deploy multi-agent solutions, breaking down silos.
High Integration Effort & Custom Interfaces: Without A2A, integrating two systems often meant designing a bespoke API or communication method for them. This manual work is error-prone, duplicative, and slows down innovation. A2A provides a pre-defined communication framework (standard message formats, discovery, etc.), which cuts down integration effort. Developers no longer have to invent protocols or negotiate formats every time agents need to talk. This standardization is analogous to how having a common data interchange format (like HTTP/JSON for web services) accelerated web development. Similarly in the AI agent world, A2A accelerates integration. It also reduces miscommunication errors – since everyone’s following the same spec, the chance of misunderstanding or wrong assumptions between teams is lower.
Security Barriers in Automation: In domains like digital payments or identity verification, one major inefficiency is the need for manual oversight or centralized hubs due to security concerns. For example, today if a payment needs to go from Account A to Account B (account-to-account payment), often a user or a centralized service has to initiate it, because two banks’ systems won’t just talk to each other freely. With a protocol like A2A, you could envision each bank having an agent that can communicate requests directly, with proper authentication. A2A’s security model (mutual auth, fine-grained permission) is intended to make such direct, automated interactions trustworthy. In an authentication ecosystem, an Identity Provider agent could directly send an authentication token to a Resource Service agent once a user logs in, rather than redirecting the user through multiple web pages. By using standardized secure channels, A2A can cut down the back-and-forth in authentication flows. It essentially allows machine-to-machine trust to be established more seamlessly, where today a lot of human or out-of-band steps are needed.
Fragmented Payment Processes: In digital payments, especially cross-platform or multi-party transactions, there are many inefficiencies: multiple intermediaries, batch processing delays, and lack of real-time coordination among parties. A2A can help address some of these inefficiencies:
Direct Account-to-Account Interactions: Traditionally, an account-to-account payment (often called A2A payment in fintech) goes through networks or protocols that might not be real-time or might incur fees (e.g. ACH transfers, card networks). With an agent-based approach, a payer’s agent could directly communicate a payment request to a payee’s agent, negotiating via A2A, and then directly trigger a transfer via an open banking API. This could bypass card networks, potentially reducing fees and increasing speed ([A2A Payments: The 2025 Comprehensive Guide for Businesses](https://www.swipesum.com/insights/a2a-payments#:~:text=A2A Payments%3A The 2025 Comprehensive,like card networks or)) ([What are A2A Payments? - Chargeback Gurus](https://www.chargebackgurus.com/blog/what-are-a2a-payments#:~:text=A2A%2C or account,bank account to the seller's)). (While Google’s A2A is not itself a payment network, it provides the communication layer to implement real-time account-to-account transfers using existing payment rails in a more streamlined way.)
Multi-Party Coordination: Many payment scenarios involve more than two parties – e.g. a customer, a merchant, and perhaps intermediaries like a marketplace or a broker who takes a commission. Currently, coordinating a transaction with multiple parties (ensuring everyone gets paid their share, with appropriate approvals) is complex and often handled through centralized escrow or sequential manual steps. A2A offers a way for all the involved agents to coordinate cryptographically and asynchronously. The LinkedIn “Agent-Based Payment” example demonstrated that with A2A an End-User agent, a Travel Agent, and a Service Provider agent could each sign a portion of a digital check and pass it along, achieving a payment without needing all parties on one platform or a single synchronous call ([Google's A2A Protocol - Payments](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/googles-a2a-protocol-payments-maksym-khudiakov-ol9he#:~:text=In this agent,Check (Step 3)) ([Google's A2A Protocol - Payments](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/googles-a2a-protocol-payments-maksym-khudiakov-ol9he#:~:text=Upon validation%2C the Payment Provider,cryptographic signatures and envelope chaining)). This addresses inefficiencies like requiring all parties to be online at the same time or relying on an intermediary to forward funds. With A2A, each agent does its part and the chain of A2A messages carries the transaction through to completion, with trust enforced by digital signatures rather than by a central middleman ([Google's A2A Protocol - Payments](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/googles-a2a-protocol-payments-maksym-khudiakov-ol9he#:~:text=signatures from each party in,Step 5)). This kind of decentralized, asynchronous coordination is a novel improvement for payment flows, making them more robust to network issues (since a signed payment can be delivered later if one agent is temporarily offline) and potentially reducing the need for costly intermediaries.
Trust and Auditability: By having each step of a transaction occur via a secure A2A message, there’s a clear audit log and cryptographic proof of who agreed to what. This addresses the problem of disputes or fraud in payments – every agent’s action (like signing an e-check) can be verified. In current systems, data might be siloed; with A2A, all parties have a copy of the signed payloads exchanged, improving transparency.
Identity Verification and Credential Sharing: In digital identity ecosystems, verifying user identity or qualifications often involves repetitive manual processes – users have to submit documents to one service after another, or use federated identity systems that don’t always seamlessly integrate. With A2A, one can imagine an Identity Agent that holds a user’s verified credentials (proof of ID, certificates, etc.) and can directly respond to verification requests from other service agents. For example, when signing up for a bank account, instead of uploading documents, the user’s Identity Agent could, via A2A, answer the bank’s agent with a proof token or attestation that the user is verified. This would be done securely, with the bank’s agent authenticating the identity agent (using A2A’s auth methods) and trusting the response. The efficiency gain is huge: it could eliminate redundant KYC checks and let users port their verified identity across services safely. While this scenario requires an ecosystem of trust (and A2A provides the technical means for it), it’s a direction where A2A could streamline identity verification dramatically. The protocol’s designers explicitly left room for such “trust, identity, and verifiable value exchange” frameworks to be built on top of A2A ([Google's A2A Protocol - Payments](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/googles-a2a-protocol-payments-maksym-khudiakov-ol9he#:~:text=Neither A2A nor MCP currently,verifiable value exchange between agents)), since A2A ensures the communication is there – now companies can focus on the content (the credential formats, etc.) knowing the transport is secure.
Long Waits and Lack of Responsiveness in Processes: In many current workflows (think loan approval, legal discovery, complex customer support cases), a single AI or process working alone can hit points where it must wait or is unsure, causing delays until a human intervenes. A2A can reduce these inefficiencies by allowing an agent to proactively ask for help from another agent when needed. For instance, a customer support chatbot that gets a tricky policy question could automatically invoke a “Policy QA Agent” via A2A, rather than telling the user “I’ll get back to you later.” This leads to faster responses and less human escalations. Likewise, in an authentication flow, if an authentication agent isn’t sure about a login attempt, it could query a fraud-detection agent in real time for risk assessment. In short, A2A networks create an ecosystem of expertise that any agent can tap into, reducing bottlenecks where one system’s limitations would otherwise stall the whole process.
Scalability and Manageability: As organizations deploy more AI agents, managing them individually becomes inefficient (each with separate configs, trust relationships, etc.). A2A provides a unified framework so that adding a new agent to the system is relatively plug-and-play. This addresses the scalability issue – you don’t pay an exponentially growing cost to wire up the N-th agent with all previous ones; you just ensure it speaks A2A and it can interoperate with the rest. Also, from a management perspective, A2A’s standardized logging of tasks and outcomes makes monitoring easier. Admins can use the same tools to monitor inter-agent API calls as they do for microservice calls, identifying performance issues or errors quickly. This kind of insight was harder to get when each integration was custom.
In summary, Google’s A2A protocol is intended to streamline and secure the way digital systems (agents) interact, attacking several inefficiencies at once: it cuts out middlemen by enabling direct agent communication (useful in payments and data exchange), it reduces development and integration time through standardization, it improves security and trust by building on robust auth mechanisms (making automated interactions viable in sensitive domains), and it opens the door for more autonomous, responsive processes by letting agents collaborate in real time. The innovative design of A2A – in conjunction with protocols like MCP for tool use – is a response to the demands of modern digital payment, identity, and AI-driven workflows, where the old ways (manual steps, siloed systems, custom integrations) simply can’t keep up with the speed and scale required. A2A doesn’t solve every problem (for instance, it doesn’t itself enforce business logic or provide a payment clearinghouse), but it provides the critical communication backbone upon which solutions to those problems can be built in a much more efficient way than before.

Conclusion
Google’s A2A protocol and the various “MCP” protocols represent different layers and domains of networking, but in the realm of AI agents, A2A and Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) form a complementary pair. A2A focuses on connecting autonomous agents to each other – establishing a common language for inter-agent dialogue, with an emphasis on security, openness, and scalability. MCP (Model Context Protocol) focuses on connecting agents (or AI models) to their tools and data – acting as a universal interface for an agent’s environment, ensuring it can fetch context or take actions in a controlled way. Technically, they differ in architecture (agent-to-agent HTTP calls vs. client-server tool calls), in security focus (external trust between services vs. internal safe tool use), and in purpose (collaboration vs. augmentation). Functionally, A2A is about what agents can do together, while MCP is about what an agent can do by itself with the help of tools. There is little overlap – instead, there is a strong synergy: A2A provides the network that links multiple MCP-empowered agents. Together they enable complex, multi-agent systems that are greater than the sum of their parts, all while using open standards to maximize compatibility.

Comparing A2A to other MCP interpretations (Mobile Content, Media Control, etc.) mainly serves to clarify that those share an acronym but not a mission. Mobile Content Protocol or Media Control Protocol are unrelated to A2A, as they belong to mobile content delivery and telecommunication control domains respectively. They have different architectures and goals, and there’s no direct connection or need to integrate them with A2A (unless an agent specifically needed to use one of those protocols via some adapter, which would be an edge case).

Looking at A2A’s innovations, it’s clear that Google aimed to solve pressing issues in the emerging multi-agent landscape: lack of standards, security concerns, and difficulty integrating AI into real workflows. Features like the Agent Card, JSON-RPC messaging, built-in auth, long-running task support, and multimodal capability all push the state-of-the-art forward for agent communication. These enable new possibilities – for example, an ecosystem where specialized AI services can be composed like building blocks to tackle a complex task (much as microservices can be composed in software architecture).

Crucially, A2A is tackling inefficiencies in current systems – whether by enabling more direct account-to-account interactions in payments (bypassing slow or costly intermediaries), by allowing identity verification to be reused across platforms, or simply by making it easier for businesses to deploy AI solutions that talk to each other without weeks of custom coding. By introducing a common protocol for trust and cooperation between agents, A2A lays the groundwork for a more connected, efficient digital future – one where AI agents can reliably coordinate tasks like payments, data sharing, and authentication on our behalf, much like interoperable web services do today, but with far greater autonomy and intelligence.
