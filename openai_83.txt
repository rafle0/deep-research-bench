Tablet-Style Payment Devices: A Comprehensive Analysis
Introduction
Tablet-style devices have revolutionized point-of-sale (POS) systems and SaaS application delivery in recent years. These devices range from dedicated all-in-one payment terminals to off-the-shelf consumer tablets outfitted with card readers and POS software. In this report, we will explore the major manufacturers and their device models, comparing hardware configurations such as screen size, operating system, and built-in peripherals. We also examine the primary use cases across industries – from retail checkout counters and restaurant tableside ordering to healthcare kiosks and field service terminals – highlighting how these tablet POS solutions are deployed. Finally, we analyze market penetration, typical usage scenarios, price ranges, and estimated installed bases in four key regions: North America, Japan/Korea, Southeast Asia, and South America. The goal is to provide a structured, detailed overview of the current landscape of tablet-based payment and SaaS devices.

Major Manufacturers and Tablet POS Devices
Square (Block Inc.) – Square Register & Terminal
(PROVANTAGE: Square A-SKU-0665 Square Register) Square Register features a 13.3″ primary touchscreen and a detachable customer-facing display, forming an all-in-one countertop POS ([Register (Powered by Square POS) Black A-SKU-0665 - Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/register-powered-by-square-pos-black/6459037.p?skuId=6459037#:~:text=,1 answers)) ([Fiserv has ambitious goals for Clover. Can it meet them? | Payments Dive](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/fiserv-clover-growth-goals-square-jack-dorsey-smb-merchant-pos-software-services/711202/#:~:text=Clover spreads)). Square’s flagship hardware is the Square Register, a fully integrated dual-screen terminal. It consists of a 13.3″ seller-facing touchscreen (Slate gray enclosure) and a 7″ customer-facing screen for PIN entry, signature, and tipping ([Register (Powered by Square POS) Black A-SKU-0665 - Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/register-powered-by-square-pos-black/6459037.p?skuId=6459037#:~:text=

In addition to the Register, Square offers the Square Terminal, a 5.5″ touchscreen handheld payment tablet ([Credit card terminal - Technical Specifications | Square](https://squareup.com/us/en/hardware/terminal/specs#:~:text=Square Terminal measurements)). Square Terminal is a portable all-in-one card reader and receipt printer, ideal for pay-at-table in cafés or mobile merchants. It runs the same Square POS software (on a custom Android OS) and accepts swipe, dip, and tap payments ([Credit card terminal - Technical Specifications | Square](https://squareup.com/us/en/hardware/terminal/specs#:~:text=Square

For smaller footprints, Clover offers the Clover Mini, an 8″ tablet POS terminal. The newest Mini (3rd gen) upgrades to an 8″ 1280×800 touchscreen (previous models were 7″) ([Clover Mini | Small POS System](https://www.clover.com/mini?srsltid=AfmBOorkJDWTFig82NUKn1GtnwNU-WOSSCt-8J3mL_RKX0yGE4b7kAW3#:~:text=A complete point of sale,that’s better than ever)) and includes a built-in receipt printer ([Clover Mini | Small POS System](https://www.clover.com/mini?srsltid=AfmBOorkJDWTFig82NUKn1GtnwNU-WOSSCt-8J3mL_RKX0yGE4b7kAW3#:~:text=a conveniently located card slot,and contactless reader)). This makes the Mini a compact countertop device that can operate as a stand-alone register or a customer-facing checkout in addition to a Station. The Clover Flex, meanwhile, is a handheld POS device with a 6″ touch display. It is a battery-powered portable unit with an integrated card reader and printer ([Clover Flex: Handheld POS System](https://www.clover.com/flex?srsltid=AfmBOor3cVrLcfZVAuwHTiWhyNuCkJ9MhcvZoV9o05VwcWXHEyuTHnqv#::text=Payments%3A Accepts chip%2C swipe%2C and,Google Pay® and Samsung Pay®)) ([Clover Flex: Handheld POS System](https://www.clover.com/flex?srsltid=AfmBOor3cVrLcfZVAuwHTiWhyNuCkJ9MhcvZoV9o05VwcWXHEyuTHnqv#:~:text=Screen%3A Nearly 6,touch screen)).

Toast – Restaurant-Focused Tablets (Toast Flex and Toast Go)
Toast Inc. specializes in Android-based tablet POS solutions for restaurants. Its hardware is purpose-built for the rigors of food service (spill-proof, durable, fast). The Toast Flex is a 14″ touchscreen POS terminal built exclusively for restaurants ([4-1_1](https://d2c9w5yn32a2ju.cloudfront.net/knowledgebase/Toast-Hardware_Specs_DIGITAL.pdf?mtime=20201222150002&focal=none#:~:text=Power Over Ethernet 802,mount) 24 Volt Power Supply)) ([4-1_1](https://d2c9w5yn32a2ju.cloudfront.net/knowledgebase/Toast-Hardware_Specs_DIGITAL.pdf?mtime=20201222150002&focal=none#:~:text=5M FF USB Camera ,Toast Flex for Guest)). It features a full-HD 14″ display that can flip to face customers for signing or can be height-adjusted for use as a self-service kiosk ([Toast Flex | Toast POS](https://pos.toasttab.com/hardware/pos-terminal?srsltid=AfmBOopp_CodG7ZuhUFXTjCMxHzz63MIAifkt7CYxNTafjbjwwvA2puq#:~:text=Restaurant grade durability · Operating,KDS · 22” screen)). Toast Flex runs on Android 12 in newer models (with robust specs like a Rockchip processor, 4 GB RAM) ([4-1_1](https://d2c9w5yn32a2ju.cloudfront.net/knowledgebase/Toast-Hardware_Specs_DIGITAL.pdf?mtime=20201222150002&focal=none#:~:text=8” Guest Screen Direct Attach,Sensor)) ([Toast Flex | Toast POS](https://pos.toasttab.com/hardware/pos-terminal?srsltid=AfmBOopp_CodG7ZuhUFXTjCMxHzz63MIAifkt7CYxNTafjbjwwvA2puq#:~:text=Restaurant

For table service, Toast offers the Toast Go 2, a dedicated handheld POS about the size of a smartphone. Toast Go 2 has a 6.4″ touchscreen and is “restaurant-grade” (IP54 rated for water/dust) ([Toast Go 2 Review 2025 | Features, Pricing FAQs and Fees](https://gottagrow.io/reviews/toast-go2#:~:text=6,to view indoors and out)) ([Toast Go 2 Review 2025 | Features, Pricing FAQs and Fees](https://gottagrow.io/reviews/toast-go2#:~:text=weighs in at just over,to view indoors and out)). It includes an EMV chip reader and NFC built-in, allowing servers to take orders and process payments right at the table. With a weight just over 1 lb and a battery that lasts up to 24 hours on a charge ([Toast Go 2 Review 2025 | Features, Pricing FAQs and Fees](https://gottagrow.io/reviews/toast-go2#:~:text=6

Because Toast is a vertically integrated system (hardware + software), their devices are generally only sold with a Toast subscription. As of 2023, Toast served over 34,000 restaurant locations (virtually 98% in the United States) ([Toast - Market Share, Competitor Insights in POS Systems - 6Sense](https://www.6sense.com/tech/pos-systems/toast-market-share#:~:text=6Sense www,Other top)), meaning its hardware is primarily found in North America’s hospitality industry. Configuration Highlights: Toast Flex – 14″ 1080p touchscreen, flip/swivel mount, Ethernet/Wi-Fi/PoE connectivity ([4-1_1](https://d2c9w5yn32a2ju.cloudfront.net/knowledgebase/Toast-Hardware_Specs_DIGITAL.pdf?mtime=20201222150002&focal=none#:~:text=Power Over Ethernet 802,mount) 24 Volt Power Supply)), and optional accessories like kitchen-grade printers and cash drawers. Some larger restaurants also use a 22″ Toast Flex for Kitchen as a kitchen display (showing orders to chefs) ([Toast Flex | Toast POS](https://pos.toasttab.com/hardware/pos-terminal?srsltid=AfmBOopp_CodG7ZuhUFXTjCMxHzz63MIAifkt7CYxNTafjbjwwvA2puq#:~:text=Restaurant grade durability · Operating,KDS · 22” screen)). Toast Go 2 – 6.4″ touch, handheld with card reader (supports swipe, dip, tap) and an extremely long battery for all-day use ([Toast Go 2 Review 2025 | Features, Pricing FAQs and Fees](https://gottagrow.io/reviews/toast-go2#:~:text=6,to view indoors and out)) ([Toast Go 2 Review 2025 | Features, Pricing FAQs and Fees](https://gottagrow.io/reviews/toast-go2#:~:text=In addition%2C the hardware is,its predecessor%2C the Toast Go)). It’s sealed against spills and drops – critical in food service. Together, these allow tableside ordering, line busting, and pay-at-door for delivery, which have become crucial use cases in modern dining.

Apple – iPad-Based POS Solutions
Apple does not make a dedicated payment tablet, but the Apple iPad (with iPadOS) is widely used as a general-purpose POS tablet in many industries. iPads (whether the standard 10.2″ iPad, the iPad Pro 12.9″, or the iPad Mini 8″) offer high-resolution touchscreens, reliable performance, and a rich app ecosystem. Many SaaS POS providers (e.g. Square, Shopify, Lightspeed, TouchBistro) offer their software on iPad, making it a popular choice for retail boutiques, quick-service restaurants, and mobile vendors. An iPad-based POS typically requires some accessories: a stand or enclosure, a card reader, and optionally a receipt printer and cash drawer. For example, Square sells the Square Stand, which secures an iPad and has an embedded contactless+chip reader, effectively turning it into a countertop register ([iPad POS Stand — Available in USB-C | Square Stand](https://squareup.com/us/en/hardware/stand#::text=Turn your iPad into a,credit cards quickly %26 safely)) ([Square - POS Stand for iPad - (2nd generation, USB-C) - Black](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/square-pos-stand-for-ipad-2nd-generation-usb-c-black/6580215.p?skuId=6580215#:~:text=Square ,staff%2C and simplifies the dining)). Similarly, other vendors provide sleds or dongles (like the PayPal Zettle reader or Shopify Tap & Chip reader) that connect via Bluetooth to the iPad for payments.

The appeal of iPads lies in their versatility. Businesses can use the same iPad for POS, inventory management, and other SaaS apps (scheduling, loyalty, etc.). Screen sizes vary – some use iPad Minis for handheld convenience (7.9″ or the newer 8.3″ screens), while others use large 12.9″ iPad Pros as kiosk terminals for customers. All modern iPads have bright multi-touch displays and run iPadOS, which provides enterprise management features and app multitasking. They rely on Wi-Fi (or cellular if enabled) to connect to cloud services. Peripherals are attached either wirelessly or via hubs; for instance, an iPad POS station might include a Bluetooth barcode scanner, a Wi-Fi or Ethernet receipt printer, and a cash drawer triggered by the printer. Apple’s tablets are known for their premium build and cost (ranging from $329 for base iPad to $1000+ for iPad Pro). Nevertheless, the user-friendly interface and broad app support have led to strong adoption in small and mid-sized businesses worldwide ([iPad POS Software Insightful Analysis: Trends, Competitor ...](https://www.marketresearchforecast.com/reports/ipad-pos-software-41964#::text=,mobile technology in retail)). It’s reported that a significant portion of new POS software installations in retail are on iPads, especially in North America and Europe, where retailers value the familiar interface and aesthetics ([Retailers Slow to Adopt Mobile POS: Study](https://www.supermarketnews.com/foodservice-retail/retailers-slow-to-adopt-mobile-pos-study#:~:text=,based specialty chains)) ([Retailers Slow to Adopt Mobile POS: Study](https://www.supermarketnews.com/foodservice-retail/retailers-slow-to-adopt-mobile-pos-study#:~:text=

In healthcare and hospitality, iPads are also used for check-in kiosks or menus. For example, many cafes use an iPad with a swivel stand as a customer-facing order screen. The iPad’s role is typically general-purpose – it becomes a payment device only when paired with the appropriate SaaS app and reader hardware. The advantage is flexibility: if a business switches software, the iPad can run the new app (unlike locked-down dedicated terminals). The disadvantage can be durability (iPads are not spill-proof or rugged by default) and the need to manage separate components.

Samsung, Lenovo, and Other General-Purpose Tablets (Android/Windows)
Aside from Apple, numerous Android tablets and some Windows tablets are used as POS or SaaS endpoints. Samsung is a notable manufacturer – devices like the Samsung Galaxy Tab A (10.1″) or Galaxy Tab Active (8″ rugged tablet) are deployed with POS apps. These tablets run Android and can be customized or locked into kiosk mode (Samsung Knox, for instance, allows businesses to secure the tablet as a single-purpose device). In Korea and parts of Asia, Samsung tablets are popular for retail POS when paired with local payment dongles or integrated into kiosk enclosures. Samsung even introduced a commercial self-service kiosk solution that uses a large tablet touch screen for ordering in fast-food restaurants ([Why does Asia scan to pay when the rest of the world taps?](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/17/asia_qr_code_obsession/#:~:text=Why does Asia scan to,to scan a QR code)). The typical Samsung tablets used in POS have screen sizes from ~8 inches up to 10–12 inches, and their advantage is often cost (a mid-range Android tablet can be cheaper than iPads) and openness. Retailers in Southeast Asia often use Android tablets from Samsung or Huawei mounted on stands with a Bluetooth card reader to run payment apps or loyalty programs.

Lenovo also produces Android tablets that are repurposed for POS, such as the Lenovo Tab M8 or Tab M10. For instance, one POS vendor bundle uses the Lenovo Tab M8 (8″, Android 9) as a restaurant table-side order entry device (Lenovo Tablet. BPA Point of Sale). With an 8″ HD display, 3GB RAM, and 20-hour battery life, it’s sufficient for basic POS needs ([Lenovo Tablet. BPA Point of Sale](https://store.bpapos.com/lenovo-tablet#::text=,slot and combo audio jack)). Lenovo tablets are found in settings like hospitality (for table service or mobile ordering) and in retail as secondary customer displays. On the Windows side, devices like the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet or Microsoft Surface Pro sometimes serve as POS terminals, especially in enterprises that want full Windows capabilities (for example, hotels might use Surface Pro tablets on stands for check-in). However, Android and iOS devices dominate in ease-of-use and app support for modern cloud POS, whereas Windows tablets tend to be used when legacy Windows POS software is required.

Another category is specialized Android POS tablets from Chinese manufacturers. Brands like Sunmi, PAX, Ingenico, Newland, and Castles produce tablet-style payment devices widely used in Asia and beyond ([Connected POS Terminals Market Report 2025: Installed Base of Cellular POS Terminals to Reach 229 Million in 2028, mPOS Terminals Worldwide to Reach 152 Million Units by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428903740/en/Connected-POS-Terminals-Market-Report-2025-Installed-Base-of-Cellular-POS-Terminals-to-Reach-229-Million-in-2028-mPOS-Terminals-Worldwide-to-Reach-152-Million-Units-by-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com#:~:text=About 40,still less than 10 million)). For example, PAX A920 is an Android POS tablet with a 5″ screen and printer (similar in concept to Clover Flex) and is common in South America and Asia. Sunmi makes 10″ and 15″ Android POS terminals that look like Android tablets on a stand, often with integrated printers – these are popular in Southeast Asian retail. These devices might not be household brand names to consumers, but they account for a huge share of global installations – in 2023, about 40% of POS terminals sold worldwide were Android smart POS devices from manufacturers like Sunmi, PAX, Ingenico, etc. ([Connected POS Terminals Market Report 2025: Installed Base of Cellular POS Terminals to Reach 229 Million in 2028, mPOS Terminals Worldwide to Reach 152 Million Units by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428903740/en/Connected-POS-Terminals-Market-Report-2025-Installed-Base-of-Cellular-POS-Terminals-to-Reach-229-Million-in-2028-mPOS-Terminals-Worldwide-to-Reach-152-Million-Units-by-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com#:~:text=Android POS terminal category has,become very popular lately)) ([Connected POS Terminals Market Report 2025: Installed Base of Cellular POS Terminals to Reach 229 Million in 2028, mPOS Terminals Worldwide to Reach 152 Million Units by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428903740/en/Connected-POS-Terminals-Market-Report-2025-Installed-Base-of-Cellular-POS-Terminals-to-Reach-229-Million-in-2028-mPOS-Terminals-Worldwide-to-Reach-152-Million-Units-by-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com#:~:text=About

Elo Touch – Elo PayPoint All-in-One
Elo Touch Solutions offers the PayPoint series – an all-in-one POS register that integrates a tablet screen with traditional peripherals. The Elo PayPoint for Android is essentially a 13.3″ tablet POS mounted on a base that contains a built-in receipt printer, cash drawer, 1D barcode scanner, and MSR (magstripe reader) ([PayPoint® for Android™ POS System | Elo® Official Website](https://www.elotouch.com/pos-terminals-paypoint-for-android-3-0.html#:~:text=13,cash drawer keys%2C Quick)) ([PayPoint® for Android™ POS System | Elo® Official Website](https://www.elotouch.com/pos-terminals-paypoint-for-android-3-0.html#:~:text=13

The PayPoint is somewhat unique in that it includes a full-size cash drawer and printer in the base, whereas other tablet solutions often use standalone peripheral printers/drawers. This makes the footprint larger and heavier (the unit weighs 6.3 kg) ([PayPoint® for Android™ POS System | Elo® Official Website](https://www.elotouch.com/pos-terminals-paypoint-for-android-3-0.html#::text=Weight )), but it appeals to merchants who want a clean aesthetic with no clutter. Elo’s strategy bridges the gap between traditional cash registers and modern tablets by reinventing the former with a tablet interface (“The Electronic Cash Register Reinvented for the Cloud” as Elo’s marketing says). These devices tend to be used in North America and Europe by larger retail chains or franchises; Elo, being a longtime touchscreen supplier, focuses on robust hardware and leaves software choices to the customer.

Configuration Highlights: Elo PayPoint (Android) – 13.3″ touchscreen (PCAP multitouch), Android OS, internal 3″ thermal printer (Star Micronics), 5-bill/5-coin cash drawer, built-in barcode scanner (usually 1D), magstripe reader for cards ([PayPoint® for Android™ POS System | Elo® Official Website](https://www.elotouch.com/pos-terminals-paypoint-for-android-3-0.html#:~:text=13,drawer keys%2C Quick Installation Guide)) (PayPoint® for Android™ POS System | Elo® Official Website). It has multiple I/O ports (USB, Ethernet, Bluetooth, etc.) for additional accessories like scales or handheld scanners ([Elo PayPoint for Android Retail POS System with 13" Touchscreen ...](https://www.amazon.com/Elo-PayPoint-Android-Touchscreen-Barcode/dp/B09QMPNPLW#:~:text=Elo PayPoint for Android Retail,Android with Google Play Services)) ([Connected POS Terminals Market Report 2025: Installed Base of Cellular POS Terminals to Reach 229 Million in 2028, mPOS Terminals Worldwide to Reach 152 Million Units by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428903740/en/Connected-POS-Terminals-Market-Report-2025-Installed-Base-of-Cellular-POS-Terminals-to-Reach-229-Million-in-2028-mPOS-Terminals-Worldwide-to-Reach-152-Million-Units-by-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com#:~:text=About 40,still less than 10 million)). The all-in-one design is very turnkey: for a price of roughly $1,300-$1,500, a merchant gets a fully equipped register. Elo’s hardware is retail-hardened (meaning it’s built to run all day in a store) and comes with advanced warranty options (PayPoint® for Android™ POS System | Elo® Official Website). While not as common as iPad or Clover in small shops, Elo PayPoints are emblematic of dedicated POS tablets that blend old and new – particularly in department stores or restaurants that desire a modern interface without sacrificing traditional components like cash drawers.

Primary Use Cases and Industry Scenarios
Modern tablet POS devices find use across a range of industries. Below, we identify key scenarios and which types of devices are typically deployed:

Retail Checkout (Countertops): Traditional retail stores (boutiques, electronics shops, grocery stores) use tablet POS at checkout counters to replace legacy cash registers. For instance, an apparel boutique might use an iPad or Clover Mini at the counter for a sleek checkout experience, connecting wirelessly to a receipt printer and cash drawer. Larger retailers might use Clover Station or Elo PayPoint for an all-in-one register that can handle high volume sales. The benefits in retail include inventory integration – the tablet can show stock levels, apply discounts, and sync with e-commerce inventory in real time. Customers also see a more modern, less bulky register. Specialty retail has embraced iPad POS – up to 45% of tablets shipped to retail for POS are used by specialty and independent retailers ([Retailers Slow to Adopt Mobile POS: Study](https://www.supermarketnews.com/foodservice-retail/retailers-slow-to-adopt-mobile-pos-study#:~:text=In other findings of the,research)) ([Retailers Slow to Adopt Mobile POS: Study](https://www.supermarketnews.com/foodservice-retail/retailers-slow-to-adopt-mobile-pos-study#:~:text=,based specialty chains)), indicating how common this scenario is. In electronics stores or pop-up shops, mobile tablets (like Square Terminal or Clover Flex) are used to line-bust – staff can check out customers from anywhere in the store to reduce wait times.
Table-Service Restaurants (Hospitality): In restaurants, tableside ordering and payment is a primary use case. Waiters equipped with handheld tablets (e.g. Toast Go 2, Clover Flex) can send orders to the kitchen instantly and process credit card payments at the table, improving efficiency and customer turnover. Full-service restaurants also use stationary tablets like Toast Flex or Clover Station at the host stand or bar for order entry and checkout. Casual dining and cafes might mount an iPad or Android tablet at the counter for customers to self-order or view the menu, or use an iPad with Square for quick checkout at the register. Quick-service restaurants (QSRs) often deploy kiosk tablets – for example, a fast-food chain might have a Samsung tablet kiosk for customers to place orders and pay via the tablet, reducing the load on cashiers. The durability and spill-resistance of devices like Toast’s and Clover’s are specifically tailored to the hospitality environment (resisting grease, heat, and frequent handling). During the COVID-19 pandemic, many restaurants also adopted tablet-based pay-at-table and curbside devices to enable contactless service.
Hotels and Hospitality: Beyond restaurants, tablets are used in hotels for check-in/check-out kiosks or at concierge desks. An iPad running a property management SaaS app can expedite guest check-in and even act as a key encoder with proper attachments. For room service or poolside ordering, rugged tablets can serve guests on the go. Some hotels provide tablets in-room for guest services (not payments per se, but as SaaS endpoints for requests). At events and resorts, mobile POS tablets allow staff to make sales anywhere (for example, a resort staffer can rent out equipment by taking a Surface Go tablet and card reader to the beach).
Healthcare and Clinics: In healthcare settings, tablet-style devices are used as self-service check-in or payment kiosks for patients. For example, a clinic may have a stand with a Microsoft Surface or iPad where patients can fill forms and pay co-pays. The payments might be processed via a connected card reader (since patient privacy is important, these are often on stands in semi-private areas). Rugged tablets on carts are also used in hospitals for bedside payments (e.g., paying for a prescription or service before discharge). Additionally, pharmacies use tablet POS at the register – an iPad with a card reader can handle prescription purchases and integrate with pharmacy management SaaS systems. The healthcare use case values ease of sanitization (touchscreens that can be cleaned) and integration with scheduling/billing systems.
Field Service and Delivery: Tablet devices enable payments and SaaS applications beyond brick-and-mortar locations. Field service technicians (plumbers, HVAC, delivery drivers) often carry a rugged tablet or large smartphone to manage work orders and accept payments on site. For instance, a delivery driver might use an Android phablet with a card swipe attachment to accept a credit card upon delivering furniture. Companies like UPS historically used custom devices, but many have moved to more standard rugged tablets that run logistics software and also handle signatures and payments. In these scenarios, durability is key – devices like the Zebra XPad or Panasonic Toughpad (Windows/Android rugged tablets) are common. They have protective casings, sunlight-readable screens, and long battery life ([Rugged Tablets for Field Service - Zebra Technologies](https://mktg.zebra.com/madefor_fs_us_en#:~:text=Rugged Tablets for Field Service,challenges that demand extraordinary solutions)). A field service tablet will use either cellular data or offline sync to communicate. Accepting payments in the field often relies on card readers paired to the tablet via Bluetooth if not built-in. For example, a maintenance technician can swipe a customer’s card on a Miura or BBPOS reader attached to their tablet after completing a job, instantly emailing the receipt through the SaaS app.
Warehousing and Logistics: In warehouses, forklift-mounted tablets and handheld POS-style devices are used for inventory management and sometimes payment (e.g., when delivery COD payments are needed). These aren’t POS for retail, but they are tablet SaaS devices. For instance, logistic hubs might use an Android tablet with scanning capability for package tracking. In delivery scenarios where cash-on-delivery or point-of-delivery payment is required, a device like Ingenico’s Android payment tablet might be used by couriers to swipe cards upon delivery. This is especially relevant in regions where credit on delivery is offered. The tablet allows the delivery person to generate an invoice, take payment, and have the backend systems instantly updated. Transportation industries (taxis, rideshare) also often use tablets for payment – for example, ride-hail drivers using their phone or tablet with a card reader to accept credit fares (though mobile phone apps now dominate that). In mass transit, we see conductors with mobile POS tablets to sell tickets on board. These scenarios illustrate how mobility and wireless connectivity of tablet devices open up new points of sale wherever the customer is.
Public Sector and Events: Tablets are used for payments at farmers markets, festivals, and ticketed events. Here, general-purpose tablets with card readers (Square, SumUp, etc.) are extremely popular due to their portability. A food stall at a festival might run the Square POS app on a Samsung Galaxy Tab, for instance, to accept quick payments. Event organizers also use tablets for ticket scanning and sales at the door. In government services, one might find tablets at DMV offices or city halls for kiosk payments (paying a permit fee or utility bill on a stand without waiting in line for a clerk). These self-service payment kiosks often run on Android tablets locked to a single payment application.
Each industry scenario tends to prioritize certain features. Retail and hospitality prioritize customer experience (bigger screens for visuals, dual displays, fast transaction speed). Field service and logistics prioritize ruggedness and connectivity. Small/mobile businesses value affordability and ease of use (hence the prevalence of simple solutions like an iPad + Square reader). The tablet POS ecosystem has diversified to cater to all these needs with either dedicated hardware (like Toast’s restaurant-specific builds) or flexible setups using consumer tablets plus add-ons.

Market Penetration and Regional Analysis
Adoption of tablet-style payment devices varies globally due to differences in business size, legacy infrastructure, and payment preferences. Below is a breakdown of usage patterns, market penetration, typical pricing, and installed base estimates in four key regions:

North America (United States and Canada)
North America is a mature market for tablet POS, with very high adoption among small and medium businesses. The U.S., in particular, was an early adopter – led by companies like Square (founded 2009) and the ubiquity of the iPad (launched 2010). Installed Base: As of 2023, the global installed base of POS terminals was 292 million, with developed markets (like NA) largely saturated ([Connected POS Terminals Market Report 2025: Installed Base of Cellular POS Terminals to Reach 229 Million in 2028, mPOS Terminals Worldwide to Reach 152 Million Units by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428903740/en/Connected-POS-Terminals-Market-Report-2025-Installed-Base-of-Cellular-POS-Terminals-to-Reach-229-Million-in-2028-mPOS-Terminals-Worldwide-to-Reach-152-Million-Units-by-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com#::text=The global installed base of,152 million units by 2028)). A significant portion of these are now mobile/tablet POS (mPOS); worldwide mPOS installations reached 110 million in 2023 ([Connected POS Terminals Market Report 2025: Installed Base of Cellular POS Terminals to Reach 229 Million in 2028, mPOS Terminals Worldwide to Reach 152 Million Units by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428903740/en/Connected-POS-Terminals-Market-Report-2025-Installed-Base-of-Cellular-POS-Terminals-to-Reach-229-Million-in-2028-mPOS-Terminals-Worldwide-to-Reach-152-Million-Units-by-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com#:~:text=electronic payments in emerging markets,152 million units by 2028)), and North America accounts for a large chunk of that. For example, Square alone had over 2 million merchant users by 2017 and has grown since (Square (Block) Statistics for 2024 | Latest User Counts and More) ([Square (Block) Statistics for 2024 | Latest User Counts and More](https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/square-statistics/#:~:text=2 million merchants )). Clover reports about 700,000 businesses (mostly in the U.S.) using its hardware/software ([Fiserv has ambitious goals for Clover. Can it meet them? | Payments Dive](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/fiserv-clover-growth-goals-square-jack-dorsey-smb-merchant-pos-software-services/711202/#:~:text=Clover spreads)), and Toast is used by tens of thousands of U.S. restaurants ([Toast - Market Share, Competitor Insights in POS Systems - 6Sense](https://www.6sense.com/tech/pos-systems/toast-market-share#:~:text=6Sense www,Other top)). These numbers indicate that in North America, millions of tablet POS devices are active. The region also sees regular upgrades as technology improves (e.g., many merchants who started with an iPad 4 + Square reader have moved to an iPad Air + Square Stand over time).

Market Penetration: It’s common to see tablet POS even in very small businesses – from food trucks to salon booths – where previously only cash was an option. Roughly 28% of North American retailers planned to adopt mobile POS by 2013 and that number only grew ([Retailers Slow to Adopt Mobile POS: Study](https://www.supermarketnews.com/foodservice-retail/retailers-slow-to-adopt-mobile-pos-study#:~:text=The mobile POS market will,retailer and volume of transactions)) ([Retailers Slow to Adopt Mobile POS: Study](https://www.supermarketnews.com/foodservice-retail/retailers-slow-to-adopt-mobile-pos-study#:~:text=POS in some form by,retailer and volume of transactions)). Large retailers supplement traditional registers with tablets for peak times (e.g., Apple Stores famously use iPhones/iPads for checkout). One study noted mobile POS would cannibalize 12% of traditional POS shipments in NA by 2016 as retailers augment with tablets ([Retailers Slow to Adopt Mobile POS: Study](https://www.supermarketnews.com/foodservice-retail/retailers-slow-to-adopt-mobile-pos-study#::text=,based specialty chains)). Now in 2025, the expectation is that virtually every new small business opts for a tablet or cloud-based POS over a legacy cash register, unless constrained by connectivity. Use Cases: In North America, credit card and digital payment usage is high, so devices like Square, Clover, and Toast thrive. Restaurants often choose Toast or Clover for full service, while micro-merchants choose Square or Shopify POS on iPad for ease. Enterprise retail chains might use custom systems, but even they are shifting – e.g., Walmart and other big-box stores have tested tablet stations for self-checkout or line-busting.

Pricing: Hardware prices in NA vary: an iPad-based setup can be a few hundred dollars (plus monthly software fees), whereas a full Clover Station or Elo system can be $1k+. Many vendors in NA offer financing or monthly plans (Square has monthly installments for hardware ([Touchscreen POS Register - Technical Specifications | Square](https://squareup.com/us/en/hardware/register/specs#:~:text=Buy Square Register)), Clover often comes via bank packages). The willingness to invest is higher given the high transaction volumes and labor savings. Additionally, North America has a robust support ecosystem – service providers, resellers, and warranties – which encourages businesses to adopt these devices knowing maintenance and replacement is manageable.

Japan & Korea
Japan and South Korea present an interesting mix of advanced consumer tech culture with some traditional payment habits. In Japan, cash was historically dominant, but the 2010s saw a push for cashless payment adoption. Tablet POS started gaining traction after companies like Square entered Japan in 2013 ([Square arrives in Japan, its first market outside North America](https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/23/4358294/jack-dorsey-square-tokyo-japan#:~:text=Square arrives in Japan%2C its,But that's still)) and local initiatives like AirREGI by Recruit launched. AirREGI, a free POS app for iPad/Android, saw 100,000 accounts in its first year in Japan (2013–2014) ([A Decade of Air BusinessTools: Based on the Concept of “Follow Your Heart, Live Your Business,” Recruit Has Been Freeing Japanese Businesses from Analog Operations - Inside Out | Recruit Holdings](https://recruit-holdings.com/en/blog/post_20240126_0001/#:~:text=In 2013%2C AirREGI ,mainly by word of mouth)), indicating rapid small-business uptake. As of 2023, Recruit’s Air BusinessTools (including AirREGI) handles 3.46 million accounts across Japan ([A Decade of Air BusinessTools: Based on the Concept of “Follow Your Heart, Live Your Business,” Recruit Has Been Freeing Japanese Businesses from Analog Operations - Inside Out | Recruit Holdings](https://recruit-holdings.com/en/blog/post_20240126_0001/#:~:text=Air BusinessTools ,productivity and profitability of corporate)) – many of those are small shops using iPads or Android tablets as their cash registers. This suggests that Japan has embraced tablet POS strongly among SMEs. It’s common in Japan to see an iPad-based register at boutique stores, clinics, and even pop-up events, often with integrated QR code payment support (since QR/mobile payments like PayPay and Line Pay are popular). Additionally, Square Japan (in partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Card) has onboarded many sole proprietors and small shops to accept credit cards via iPads and Android devices (Square aims to break into cash-heavy Japanese market with mobile ...).

However, market penetration in Japan’s overall retail is still moderate – many mid-to-large retailers use proprietary systems (often Windows-based or bespoke hardware by companies like NEC, Fujitsu). Tablet POS is gaining ground in sectors like cafes, fast fashion stores, and service industries. The Japanese government’s cashless promotion campaigns (around the 2020 Olympics, for example) encouraged merchants to adopt modern POS to accept e-payments, which often meant subsidizing tablet terminals. Use Cases: Food service in Japan sees tablet tech not just at the checkout but also at tables – it’s common to have customer-facing order tablets at izakaya (pubs) or ramen shops, though these are often rugged custom tablets mounted at the table (for self-ordering) rather than general POS tablets. Still, those indicate comfort with tablet interfaces. For mobile merchants and delivery (like Japan’s takkyubin services), acceptance of credit cards via mobile devices is less common than in NA; many Japanese deliveries still rely on cash or cashless via QR. But taxi companies have started using tablet-like payment devices for credit cards as well.

In South Korea, technology adoption is high and digital payments (credit cards, mobile wallets) are ubiquitous. Most merchants have modern POS systems, though many are integrated with the government’s tax systems and use secure terminals (Korea was an early adopter of smart card payments). Tablet POS exists – especially with the rise of franchise coffee shops and boutique stores that opt for iPad-based systems – but the market has a lot of local solutions. Companies like Kakao and Naver have payment platforms that might tie into tablet hardware. Also, Korean tech firms (e.g. Samsung SDS) could produce specialized POS tablets for domestic use. It’s not uncommon in Seoul to see a Galaxy tablet at a cafe counter running a POS app with a small card reader. But just as common are fully integrated touchscreen terminals provided by banks or payment processors (which might run Windows).

Market Penetration: Both Japan and Korea have a high number of small merchants who could benefit from tablets. Square is active in Japan (less so in Korea). In Korea, perhaps local startups like I’mPORT or GalaxiaMoneytree have offered tablet-based POS solutions. Overall, penetration is growing – possibly tens of thousands of devices in use in each country, but not as saturated as North America. Many merchants in Japan/Korea still use older cash registers or PC-based POS, but new establishments lean toward tablets for their lower upfront cost and multi-language support (important in tourist areas). Pricing: In Japan, iPads are pricey due to import costs, so some merchants use domestic Android tablets or older iPad models to save cost. The AirREGI model being free software lowered the barrier – a merchant just needed a tablet and internet. In Korea, hardware might be subsidized by merchant acquiring banks to encourage card acceptance, so a proprietor might get a tablet terminal “free” with their card processing contract. Korean consumers also heavily use QR Code and mobile app payments (like KakaoPay); accordingly, POS setups, whether tablet or not, must support scanning those – many tablet POS apps in Korea integrate QR code scanners (often using the tablet’s camera or a paired scanner).

Southeast Asia
Southeast Asia is a diverse region, but generally, it has been leapfrogging to mobile POS, aided by the proliferation of smartphones and lower cost Android devices. In countries like Singapore and Malaysia, many SMEs have adopted iPad or Android tablet POS systems, especially in food & beverage and retail segments. For instance, Singapore’s hawker stalls increasingly use Android tablets with payment apps or iPads with systems like StoreHub or Moka (local POS SaaS). Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand have a mix of cash-based traditional commerce and cutting-edge digital startups – tablets find space particularly in urban centers and chain establishments. Companies like Grab and GoJek have equipped some partner merchants with payment tablets or at least phone-based POS to handle their e-wallet transactions.

One notable trend in Southeast Asia is the popularity of Chinese-made Android POS hardware. Brands such as Sunmi and PAX are widely distributed. For example, Sunmi’s Android terminal (with tablet form factor) might be the choice for a cafe in Bangkok or a boutique in Jakarta because it’s affordable and often bundled with local POS software. These all-in-one Android devices often come with built-in receipt printers and scanners, catering well to local needs. Indeed, globally top vendors like Sunmi and PAX, which are strong in Asia, have made Android POS a major category (accounting for 40% of POS shipments worldwide in 2023) ([Connected POS Terminals Market Report 2025: Installed Base of Cellular POS Terminals to Reach 229 Million in 2028, mPOS Terminals Worldwide to Reach 152 Million Units by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428903740/en/Connected-POS-Terminals-Market-Report-2025-Installed-Base-of-Cellular-POS-Terminals-to-Reach-229-Million-in-2028-mPOS-Terminals-Worldwide-to-Reach-152-Million-Units-by-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com#::text=Android POS terminal category has,become very popular lately)), much of it in Asia-Pacific. This means hundreds of thousands of such devices are in use across Southeast Asia. For example, in Indonesia, GoJek’s Selly and Moka POS (now part of GoTo group) have signed up many small cafes and retailers, often using Android tablets or smartPOS terminals to accept cards and digital payments. Malaysia and Thailand have seen banks and fintechs deploy Android POS tablets to merchants as part of cashless drives.

However, an interesting dynamic is the rise of QR code payments in SE Asia (and Asia in general). Systems like Thailand’s PromptPay QR, Singapore’s PayNow QR, and various e-wallet QR codes mean some micro-merchants skipped physical POS devices altogether in favor of printed QR codes. This can reduce the need for each merchant stall to have a card terminal or tablet – the customer just scans a QR with their phone to pay. For larger merchants though, a tablet POS that can display a QR code to be scanned or scan the customer’s QR is useful. Many tablet POS apps in the region now integrate local e-wallets (e.g., a POS app in Malaysia might generate a Boost or Touch ’n Go eWallet QR for the customer to scan). So the tablet might not process the card, but it coordinates the transaction.

Market Penetration: By region, Singapore likely has the highest penetration of tablet POS in SMEs (given its tech-forward approach and government incentives for digitalization). Indonesia and Vietnam have huge numbers of small merchants, many still cash-based or using mobile phone apps. But one estimate indicates Asia-Pacific (including SE Asia) already accounts for about 30% of the mPOS revenue globally ([mPOS Terminal Market Size & Share, Analysis Report 2032](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/mobile-point-of-sale-mpos-terminals-market#:~:text=mPOS Terminal Market Size %26,demand for mPOS terminals)), signaling strong growth. With populations getting accustomed to digital payments, even roadside vendors are starting to use simple POS readers or apps. We can estimate that in Southeast Asia, hundreds of thousands of tablet/mobile POS devices are active, especially if we include smartphone-as-POS (SoftPOS) usage. Indeed, globally SoftPOS (using just a phone as a card reader via NFC) is emerging, but currently under 10 million users ([Connected POS Terminals Market Report 2025: Installed Base of Cellular POS Terminals to Reach 229 Million in 2028, mPOS Terminals Worldwide to Reach 152 Million Units by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428903740/en/Connected-POS-Terminals-Market-Report-2025-Installed-Base-of-Cellular-POS-Terminals-to-Reach-229-Million-in-2028-mPOS-Terminals-Worldwide-to-Reach-152-Million-Units-by-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com#:~:text=About 40,still less than 10 million)) – some of which will be in SE Asia where small merchants might use an app-only solution to accept payments (e.g., tapping cards on an NFC-enabled Android phone).

Price Ranges: Affordability is key in SE Asia. Android POS devices from Chinese brands can cost as low as USD $150-$300 per unit, far cheaper than an iPad-based setup. This has driven adoption in price-sensitive markets. Some vendors operate on a monthly rental model (e.g., $10/month for a device and software). There are also donor-funded and government programs (especially in emerging ASEAN economies) that distribute simple POS devices to encourage digital payments (for tax tracking and financial inclusion).

South America
South America (and Latin America broadly) has seen rapid growth in electronic payments and with it, point-of-sale modernization. However, the approach is slightly different: smartphone-based card readers (like Clip in Mexico, MercadoPago Point in Brazil/Argentina, or SumUp in Brazil) have been extremely popular, often more than full tablet terminals. That said, as small businesses formalize, many have moved from just a phone+reader to a more robust tablet-based POS to manage inventory and reporting.

Brazil is the largest market, and it has multiple fintechs (PagSeguro, Stone, Mercado Pago, SumUp) flooding merchants with low-cost Android payment devices. Many of these devices are pocket-sized or handheld Android terminals, not far off from Clover Flex or Square Terminal in concept. For example, PagSeguro’s Moderninha devices are basically Android card terminals with small screens; recently they introduced larger touchscreen models as well. MercadoLibre’s Mercado Pago has the “Point Plus” device – an Android tablet-with-printer form factor used by merchants in Brazil and Argentina. These are dedicated payment tablets (not general app platforms for other SaaS tasks), but they sometimes allow basic POS features (like item catalogs). Additionally, PAX Technology (China) has a strong presence via banks in Latin America – devices like the PAX A920 and A930 (which are full Android touchscreen handhelds) are used by merchants through banking contracts.

For more complex POS needs (restaurants, retail chains), iPad and Android tablet POS systems do exist. Mexico has seen growth of iPad POS in trendy restaurants and shops, often using systems from U.S. providers (Shopify, Lightspeed) or local ones like Alegra POS. Colombia, Chile, Peru – startups have offered tablet POS SaaS to SMBs (e.g., VendTy in Colombia or Candy in Mexico). Still, the penetration is not uniform; many small Latin American merchants either remain on older cash registers or jump straight to mobile phone apps (like using WhatsApp and an integrated payment link).

Installed Base: Latin America’s total POS installations are growing; one report noted cash usage fell from 67% to much lower in the 2010s as cards and digital took over ([Cashless Wave Sweeps Latin America Amid Mobile, FinTech Boom](https://www.pymnts.com/news/mobile-commerce/2025/cashless-wave-sweeps-latin-america-amid-mobile-fintech-boom/#:~:text=Cashless Wave Sweeps Latin America,of)). As a proxy, the installed base of cellular POS terminals in Brazil is among the highest in the world ([Connected POS Terminals Market Report 2025: Installed Base of Cellular POS Terminals to Reach 229 Million in 2028, mPOS Terminals Worldwide to Reach 152 Million Units by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428903740/en/Connected-POS-Terminals-Market-Report-2025-Installed-Base-of-Cellular-POS-Terminals-to-Reach-229-Million-in-2028-mPOS-Terminals-Worldwide-to-Reach-152-Million-Units-by-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com#:~:text=The market for NFC,has become very popular lately)) (given the popularity of wireless standalone devices for card payments). We can infer that millions of smart POS terminals (handheld and desktop) are active in Brazil alone. Many of those are not “tablet” in shape (some have physical keypads), but the trend is toward full touchscreen Android devices – effectively tablets with card slots. For example, Ingenico’s AXIUM DX8000 (an 8″ Android tablet POS) has been rolled out in Latin America by some acquirers.

Use Cases: In retail and hospitality in South America, one might see a mix – an upscale restaurant in São Paulo could use an iPad with a software like Micros Simphony (Oracle) or a local cloud POS on a Samsung tablet, whereas a neighborhood eatery might just use a basic Stone or SumUp terminal for card swipes. The retail chains, like supermarkets or department stores, often use traditional POS systems (PCs with POS software and Ingenico terminals). But independent and small chain stores are embracing integrated Android POS. Argentina has high smartphone penetration but also inflation issues – interestingly, many stores there started using tablet POS to process the many installment-based credit card transactions and track dynamic pricing. Chile with its modern infrastructure has startups offering tablet POS to small retail, though RedCompra (bank system) terminals are still prevalent.

Price and Access: Cost is a major factor – many Latin American merchants cannot afford a $1000 setup. The success of companies like SumUp (which offers a reader for $20) or MercadoPago (often subsidizing devices) shows that low cost wins. Therefore, the most widespread “tablet” in Latin America might actually be the customer’s smartphone (for QR payments) or a cheap custom Android device given out by a payment company. That said, as businesses grow, they are investing in more full-featured POS. The average price range for a decent tablet POS device (like a Sunmi T2 or PAX E500 with printer) in Latin America might be around $300–$500, which is more accessible if offered on installments. Many businesses also tie the device cost to transaction fees (essentially getting the hardware free and paying slightly higher processing fees).

Regional Challenges: Internet reliability and power stability can be issues in parts of South America, so devices that offer offline mode (e.g., Square’s offline transactions or offline cache in an app) are important ([Credit card terminal - Technical Specifications | Square](https://squareup.com/us/en/hardware/terminal/specs#:~:text=Offline payments² Let customers dip%2C,Additional terms apply)). Some tablets have dual SIM slots for cellular backup to keep payments going. Additionally, local regulations (fiscal printers, receipts) can affect adoption – e.g., Brazil requires fiscal receipt printers that produce a tax document, so any tablet POS needs to interface with those or have certified printing. Companies like Clover and Square do not natively operate in most of South America (except Square in some pilot in Brazil possibly, but generally not), so local or regional players fill the gap with compliant solutions.

In summary, South America is rapidly adopting mobile and tablet POS, led by Brazil. The installed base is growing as cashless trends sweep the region – PYMNTS.com noted a “cashless wave” with digital payments surging in LATAM ([Cashless Wave Sweeps Latin America Amid Mobile, FinTech Boom](https://www.pymnts.com/news/mobile-commerce/2025/cashless-wave-sweeps-latin-america-amid-mobile-fintech-boom/#:~:text=Cashless Wave Sweeps Latin America,of)). While many micro-merchants use simple readers, an increasing number of SMEs are upgrading to tablet-based systems for the richer features (inventory, CRM, analytics). By 2025, we expect Latin America to be one of the highest-growth regions for smart POS, with some analysts projecting double-digit CAGR in POS installations ([Latin America POS Terminal Market - Growth, Trends & Size](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/latin-america-pos-terminal-market#:~:text=Latin America POS Terminal Market,Limited%2C PAX Technology and)).

Conclusion
Tablet-style payment and SaaS devices have become a cornerstone of modern commerce, from the boutique shops of New York and the street food stalls of Bangkok to the cafes of Tokyo and the markets of São Paulo. Major providers like Square, Clover, and Toast have popularized dedicated POS tablets that bundle hardware and software for ease of use, especially in North America. Meanwhile, the versatility of consumer tablets like iPads and Samsung Galaxy Tabs has allowed countless businesses worldwide to customize their own POS solutions. These devices are found in retail (for faster, more engaging checkouts), hospitality (for improved service and table-turnover), healthcare (streamlining patient payments), and even in field service and delivery (bringing the checkout to the customer).

Regionally, adoption correlates with payment behavior shifts: North America’s card-heavy culture fostered millions of tablet POS deployments, Japan and Korea’s small merchants are gradually transitioning with help from local innovations, Southeast Asia’s leap to mobile wallets is intertwining with tablet POS growth, and South America’s fintech boom is equipping merchants with affordable smart terminals. The installed base of tablet POS is now in the many millions globally and growing steadily as even the smallest enterprises embrace digital sales. In 2023, an estimated 110 million mPOS terminals were in use worldwide ([Connected POS Terminals Market Report 2025: Installed Base of Cellular POS Terminals to Reach 229 Million in 2028, mPOS Terminals Worldwide to Reach 152 Million Units by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428903740/en/Connected-POS-Terminals-Market-Report-2025-Installed-Base-of-Cellular-POS-Terminals-to-Reach-229-Million-in-2028-mPOS-Terminals-Worldwide-to-Reach-152-Million-Units-by-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com#:~:text=electronic payments in emerging markets,152 million units by 2028)), and that number is on track to reach 150+ million by 2028, a significant portion of which are tablet-style devices.

Moving forward, we can expect further convergence of form factors – the distinction between a “tablet POS” and a “smartphone POS” is blurring as all devices become powerful and payments-enabled. SoftPOS solutions (turning the tablet/phone itself into a contactless card acceptor) may further accelerate adoption, especially in emerging markets, by eliminating even the card reader hardware. Additionally, more industries (like logistics and healthcare) will find bespoke SaaS apps running on tablets to improve their operations. Tablet POS systems will also continue to integrate with cloud services – providing business owners analytics, remote management, and integration with e-commerce, which in turn drives more value from these devices beyond just payment acceptance.

In conclusion, tablet-style payment devices have proven their worth across industries and regions by offering flexibility, user-friendly interfaces, and connectivity that traditional registers lacked. They have empowered small businesses with enterprise-grade capabilities and given large enterprises new mobility. As technology and payment ecosystems evolve (with trends like QR payments, NFC phones, and IoT), these tablet-based systems are likely to adapt rather than be replaced – serving as the central hub for an ever-expanding array of cashless payment options and business management tools ([Connected POS Terminals Market Report 2025: Installed Base of Cellular POS Terminals to Reach 229 Million in 2028, mPOS Terminals Worldwide to Reach 152 Million Units by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428903740/en/Connected-POS-Terminals-Market-Report-2025-Installed-Base-of-Cellular-POS-Terminals-to-Reach-229-Million-in-2028-mPOS-Terminals-Worldwide-to-Reach-152-Million-Units-by-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com#:~:text=2023 with annual shipments reaching,has become very popular lately)) ([Connected POS Terminals Market Report 2025: Installed Base of Cellular POS Terminals to Reach 229 Million in 2028, mPOS Terminals Worldwide to Reach 152 Million Units by 2028 - ResearchAndMarkets.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428903740/en/Connected-POS-Terminals-Market-Report-2025-Installed-Base-of-Cellular-POS-Terminals-to-Reach-229-Million-in-2028-mPOS-Terminals-Worldwide-to-Reach-152-Million-Units-by-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com#:~:text=About 40,still less than 10 million)). The global trajectory is clear: whether it’s a dedicated POS terminal or a consumer tablet repurposed for business, the age of the cloud-connected, tablet-driven point of sale is here to stay, reinventing the checkout experience around the world.
