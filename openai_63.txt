Mitigating Plasma Etch Damage in Lithium Niobate for Nonlinear Photonics
Introduction
Lithium niobate (LiNbO3, LN) is a critical material for nonlinear photonic devices due to its large second-order nonlinearity and electro-optic properties () ([High density lithium niobate photonic integrated circuits | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40502-8#:~:text=poling of thin film,While for)). Recent availability of thin-film lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) has enabled high-density integrated photonic circuits including modulators, frequency comb sources, and on-chip frequency converters ([High density lithium niobate photonic integrated circuits | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40502-8#:~:text=commercial availability of lithium niobate,optical frequency conversion 55 and)). However, a major fabrication challenge is pattern transfer in LN, which typically relies on plasma dry etching. LN is a ternary oxide (Li2O–Nb2O5) and does not etch as cleanly as conventional semiconductors like Si or even SiN (). Dry-etch processes must be carefully optimized to avoid material damage that can degrade optical performance. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of strategies to mitigate such damage after plasma etching of LN, covering the influence of crystal orientation, plasma etch techniques, types of damage, post-etch treatments, and the resultant impact on photonic device metrics.

LN Crystal Orientations and Material Considerations
Crystal Cut and LNOI: Lithium niobate is a non-centrosymmetric crystal with a strong polarization along the z-axis. LN wafers are commonly available in X-cut, Y-cut, or Z-cut orientations, referring to which crystallographic axis is normal to the wafer. This orientation can significantly affect etching behavior. For example, in wet etching of bulk LN, different crystal faces etch at different rates and angles (the –Z face can etch more cleanly at 80° sidewall, whereas +Z and –Y faces may only achieve ~45° slopes) ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#::text=The wet,4)). While plasma etching is more directionally driven by the ion flux, the intrinsic polarity of LN still matters. Studies have shown that during physical sputter-etch (argon ion milling), redeposition of sputtered material can differ on +Z vs. –Z sidewalls ([(PDF) Redeposition-free inductively-coupled plasma etching of lithium niobate for integrated photonics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367129327_Redeposition-free_inductively-coupled_plasma_etching_of_lithium_niobate_for_integrated_photonics#:~:text=getting redeposited on the features,…)). Figure 1(C) of Kaufmann et al. illustrates that more redeposited film accumulates on the +Z sidewall, likely due to differences in surface charge and secondary emission ([(PDF) Redeposition-free inductively-coupled plasma etching of lithium niobate for integrated photonics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367129327_Redeposition-free_inductively-coupled_plasma_etching_of_lithium_niobate_for_integrated_photonics#:~:text=work is shown as well,The redeposition)). Thus, the choice of crystal cut (and whether the etch is through the +Z or –Z face) can influence sidewall quality.

Thin-Film LN on Insulator (LNOI): LNOI typically consists of a thin X-cut or Z-cut LN device layer bonded on an oxide insulator (). LNOI enables tightly confined ridge waveguides but also introduces additional considerations. The bonding and ion-slicing fabrication of LNOI can leave residual stress and lattice damage in the thin film. Manufacturers often perform an anneal to improve crystallinity of LNOI after ion slicing ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#:~:text=annealed at atmospheric pressures in,520 ○C for two hours)). For example, post-fabrication annealing of thin-film LN (520 °C in O2) has been shown to repair lattice damage and achieve near-intrinsic optical loss (Q ≈ 1.6×108, or 0.2 dB/m) ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#::text=annealed

Material Stoichiometry and Doping: LN is typically congruent (slightly Li-deficient) or stoichiometric depending on growth. Proton exchange (replacing Li+ with H+) or MgO-doping are known modifications. For plasma etching, one clever strategy is to reduce the Li content at the surface before etching, since Li is implicated in non-volatile byproducts like LiF. Proton-exchanged LN (where a surface layer Li1-xHxNbO3 is formed) has lower LiF redeposition during subsequent fluorine-based etching (). This can enable deeper, cleaner etches – e.g. >1 μm deep features with reduced roughness were achieved on H+-exchanged LN (). The trade-off is that proton exchange alters the crystal structure and can suppress ferroelectric domain switching ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#:~:text=kinetic simulations of the PE,wall memory devices)), which is unacceptable if periodic poling is needed later. An alternative reported in 2022 is an H2-plasma surface treatment: Aryal et al. demonstrated that brief exposure to hydrogen plasma effectively substitutes some Li with H at the top surface (analogous to proton exchange) ([High-Quality Dry Etching of LiNbO3 Assisted by Proton Substitution through H2-Plasma Surface Treatment](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/16/2836#:~:text=samples were treated with H_{2},our plasma dry etch method)). This protonated surface mitigates internal depolarization fields on +Z faces and improved metal mask adhesion and etch fidelity on X- and Y-cut LN ([High-Quality Dry Etching of LiNbO3 Assisted by Proton Substitution through H2-Plasma Surface Treatment](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/16/2836#:~:text=H_{2},quality of the etching profile)). In short, tailoring the surface chemistry via doping or orientation-specific pretreatments can greatly influence how resistant LN is to plasma damage.

Plasma Etching Techniques for LN
Several dry etching methods are employed for patterning lithium niobate, each with distinct damage mechanisms:

Reactive Ion Etching (RIE): Conventional RIE is a parallel-plate capacitively coupled plasma that relies on reactive gases (and some ion energy from bias) to etch. In LN, fluorine-based RIE processes have been widely attempted (e.g. SF6, CF4, C3F8) ([Surface roughness of Ti:LiNbO3 etched by Ar∕C3F8 plasma and ...](https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article/24/2/675/930471/Surface-roughness-of-Ti-LiNbO3-etched-by-Ar-C3F8#:~:text=Surface roughness of Ti%3ALiNbO3 etched,using neutral loop discharge plasma)). Fluorine can chemically attack LN, forming volatile Nb/F/O species and LiF. However, LN’s complexity means not all reaction products are volatile at typical temperatures. LiF in particular has a high sublimation point (800 °C) and tends to condense on surfaces ([High-Quality Dry Etching of LiNbO3 Assisted by Proton Substitution through H2-Plasma Surface Treatment](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/16/2836#::text=different plasma etch conditions have,the etching process%2C resulting in)). Thus pure chemical RIE with fluorine often suffers from redeposition of LiF byproduct, which then acts as a mask on sidewalls or trenches, causing roughness (). Chlorine-based RIE (e.g. Cl2/BCl3) has also been explored. Chlorine forms LiCl and NbClx compounds; notably, LiCl has a low melting point and is more easily removed during etch ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#:~:text=to fabricate LNO optical waveguide,scale)). As a result, Cl-based plasmas can yield smoother morphology with less sidewall deposition. For instance, Bahadori et al. (2019) achieved smooth sidewalls 83° steep using an Ar/Cl2/BCl3 ICP-RIE process ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#::text=strict requirements for etching equipment%2C,60)). The downside is that chlorine etch rates are typically lower than fluorine, and handling chlorine may require more specialized equipment ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#:~:text=point%2C it can be easily,in 2019%2C Bahadori et al)). In summary, standard RIE can pattern LN but must battle low volatility etch products and often yields sloped sidewalls or requires frequent cleaning. It is also limited to relatively low plasma density, making deep etching slow.

Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Etching: ICP etchers generate a high-density plasma independently of the RF bias, allowing greater flexibility. ICP-RIE has largely superseded simple RIE for LN. The high density enables faster etching and the bias can be tuned lower to reduce ion damage. ICP with SF6-based chemistry is common for etching LNOI ridge waveguides. Research by Osipov et al. showed that heating the LN substrate during SF6/O2 ICP etching and intermittently stopping to wet-etch LiF deposits with HF greatly improved results ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#:~:text=In addition%2C there are combined,surface with metal Ti and)). By periodically removing the LiF byproduct, they attained high etch rates (100 nm/min) and excellent sidewall angles in multi-micron-deep etches ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#::text=In

Ion Beam Etching (IBE) and CAIBE: An alternative to plasma RIE is ion milling, where Ar+ ions from an ion gun physically sputter material. This is largely orientation-agnostic and can produce smooth surfaces because it does not rely on chemical volatility ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#:~:text=Focused,results in terms of etching)). Focused ion beam (FIB) milling and broad-beam ion etching have been used to etch LN microstructures with 90° sidewalls ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#::text=processing speed and excellent etching,The etching rate reached 100)). However, pure ion milling is a strong physical process that can induce a damaged amorphous layer and implant defects into LN ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#:~:text=crystal orientation of LNO%2C making,angle and a depth of)). It also has low selectivity to masks (since everything sputters at similar rates) and is slow for large areas. Chemically Assisted Ion Beam Etching (CAIBE or RIBE) introduces a reactive gas into the ion beam. For example, a CF4 or CHF3 gas can assist an Ar beam to etch LN faster than pure sputtering ([Reactive ion beam etching characteristics of LiNbO3 - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168583X87802021#:~:text=ScienceDirect www,CF 4 and CHF)). CAIBE aims to get some chemical etching to reduce the required ion energy, thereby lowering damage. While CAIBE can produce high-quality facets (historically used for optical facets in III-V and maybe LN), its use in integrated photonics is limited by throughput and equipment availability. In general, modern ICP-RIE methods have largely supplanted ion beam techniques for LN except in niche cases.

Summary of Technique Trade-offs: Physical ion milling (including CAIBE) yields excellent sidewall control and smoothness but at the cost of significant lattice damage and poor mask selectivity ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#:~:text=sidewall angle ,angle and a depth of)) (). Pure chemical RIE (fluorine-based) can preserve crystal quality but suffers from byproduct accumulation (LiF) leading to roughness (). ICP etching with carefully tuned gas chemistry is currently the workhorse for LN nanofabrication, as it can balance chemical and physical mechanisms. Nonetheless, even ICP processes often operate in a regime of partial sputtering. Kaufmann et al. note that argon-based ICP etching produces the best optical losses in LN devices, but the process window is narrow due to micro-masking by redeposited material and nearly 1:1 selectivity with typical masks ([(PDF) Redeposition-free inductively-coupled plasma etching of lithium niobate for integrated photonics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367129327_Redeposition-free_inductively-coupled_plasma_etching_of_lithium_niobate_for_integrated_photonics#:~:text=optical losses have reached remarkably,with good quality sidewalls without)). Thus, achieving a damage-mitigated etch requires optimizing several variables in tandem.

Types of Plasma Etch-Induced Damage in LN
During plasma etching of LN, several forms of material damage can occur. These include surface roughness, subsurface crystal damage, sidewall redeposition, and etch residues. Each has distinct origins and impacts on photonic performance:

Surface and Sidewall Roughness
Roughness refers to height or width irregularities on the etched surfaces (the waveguide top/bottom surfaces and sidewalls). In plasma etching, roughness can arise from mask imperfections, inhomogeneous etch rates, or micromasking. For instance, a rough lithography mask or grainy hard mask will transfer its imperfections to the LN beneath. Even with a perfect mask, redeposited fragments (e.g. LiF grains or sputtered mask material) can locally inhibit etch, causing pits or “grass” that manifest as roughness. Additionally, if the etch is anisotropic, any slight angular misalignment or crystallographic effect can cause scalloping or ripples along sidewalls. Sidewall roughness is particularly detrimental in optical waveguides because it causes light to scatter out of the mode. Scanning electron micrographs of etched LN often show sidewall scallops or slight corrugations if the process was not ideal (). In periodically poled LN (PPLN), an added complication is that domains etch at different rates chemically; a post-etch acid clean can thus reveal a periodic sidewall corrugation following the domain pattern (). This type of corrugation has been identified as a dominant loss mechanism in PPLN waveguides (). Overall, minimizing roughness is critical because even sub-10 nm amplitude sidewall variations can significantly increase propagation loss by Rayleigh scattering.

Subsurface Lattice Disruption
Energetic ion bombardment in plasma etching can damage the crystal lattice near the surface. This subsurface damage might take the form of an amorphized layer, implanted ions, or point defects (vacancies, interstitials). In LN, heavy physical bombardment (like Ar milling) is known to create a defective surface layer that can alter refractive index and absorption. Sosunov et al. found that even a brief Ar-plasma pretreatment of an X-cut LN wafer introduced lattice deformations detectable by X-ray analysis ([The Impact of Various Factors on the Surface of X-Cut Lithium Niobate and Properties of Proton-Exchange Waveguides by Aleksei V. Sosunov, Igor V. Petukhov, Vladimir Kichigin, Roman S. Ponomarev, Anatolii A. Mololkin, Mariana Kuneva :: SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/e325770d-60da-42cc-86fb-d79d67a530ee-MECA.pdf?abstractid=4386986&mirid=1#:~:text=structure and composition of surface,surface in the fabrication of)). Such lattice damage can have several consequences: increased optical absorption (due to defect states in the band gap), degradation of the nonlinear coefficient, and potentially enhanced photorefraction (as defect sites can trap charge). Fortunately, this type of damage tends to be confined to the top few nanometers to tens of nanometers of the surface. A proper annealing can heal a portion of it by allowing the crystal to recrystallize and diffusing out damage. Indeed, post-etch thermal treatments are commonly used to improve LN waveguide losses, which we will discuss in a later section. The goal during etching, however, is to minimize ion energies and fluxes that cause such damage in the first place. Using ICP with low DC bias or adding chemical etchants to reduce required physical sputtering are effective tactics (e.g., one can lower the RF bias to ~100–200 V in a high-density plasma to reduce penetration depth of damage). It is also worth noting that any subsurface damaged layer that does remain can slightly reduce the effective mode size (since the mode sees a lower index or less nonlinearity in that layer), potentially affecting phase matching for nonlinear interactions.

Sidewall Redeposition and Etch Byproducts
Redeposition refers to material that is sputtered or chemically ejected from the substrate but then re-attaches to the substrate, often on feature sidewalls. In LN etching, redeposition is a notorious issue, especially with physical or fluorine-based processes. As described earlier, LiF byproduct is a main culprit. During etching with SF6 or other F sources, Li in LN can form LiF which, being non-volatile at process temperature, will redeposit onto nearby surfaces ([High-Quality Dry Etching of LiNbO3 Assisted by Proton Substitution through H2-Plasma Surface Treatment](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/16/2836#:~:text=different plasma etch conditions have,the etching process%2C resulting in)) (). Sputtered Nb or mask material can also redeposit. This manifests as a sort of passivation on sidewalls – in mild cases it can even help protect sidewalls, but typically it is non-uniform and causes microscale masking. Kaufmann et al. detail how redeposited LN fragments create micromasking, leading to trenching at the feature bottom and faceted, rough sidewalls ([(PDF) Redeposition-free inductively-coupled plasma etching of lithium niobate for integrated photonics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367129327_Redeposition-free_inductively-coupled_plasma_etching_of_lithium_niobate_for_integrated_photonics#:~:text=etching process with details about,1 μm wide structure covered)) ([(PDF) Redeposition-free inductively-coupled plasma etching of lithium niobate for integrated photonics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367129327_Redeposition-free_inductively-coupled_plasma_etching_of_lithium_niobate_for_integrated_photonics#:~:text=the substrate at grazing angles%3B,…)). They found that at very low pressure (≈1 mTorr) and optimized bias, an Argon ICP etch can reach a “redeposition-free” regime where essentially all sputtered material escapes without sticking ([(PDF) Redeposition-free inductively-coupled plasma etching of lithium niobate for integrated photonics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367129327_Redeposition-free_inductively-coupled_plasma_etching_of_lithium_niobate_for_integrated_photonics#:~:text=Influence of chamber pressure,…)). However, operating in that regime requires careful tuning of pressure, bias, and mask, and often etch rate is sacrificed. If redeposition is not prevented in situ, a post-etch wet clean is usually required to strip the deposits. A common practice is an HF dip or an RCA clean (a sequence of H2O2/NH4OH and H2O2/HCl soaks) to remove metal or fluoride residues. RCA cleans have successfully removed redeposited LN after Ar milling (), but they must be used with caution on PPLN to avoid selective etching of domains (which caused the corrugations mentioned). In summary, sidewall redeposition is a form of collateral damage from the etch that leads to roughness and often necessitates extra cleaning steps or multistage processes to eliminate.

Etch Residues and Contaminants
Beyond redeposited substrate material, other residues can remain after etching. These include mask remnants, polymer films, or reaction products. For example, a photoresist mask will typically form a cross-linked crust when exposed to plasma, especially if O2 or other polymerizing gases are present. After etching LN, it’s often observed that standard solvents can’t fully remove the resist because it has been hardened by plasma. One case reported required a lengthy SC-1 (NH4OH/H2O2) boil to strip residual resist after Ar plasma etch ([Fabrication of Low Loss Lithium Niobate Rib Waveguides through ...](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/4563994/4814557/09950703.pdf#:~:text=Fabrication of Low Loss Lithium,to remove the PR)). If a metal mask (like Cr or Al) is used, any remaining metal on the sidewalls or surface can increase loss (metal near optical mode causes absorption). Such masks need to be wet-etched away (Cr in ceric ammonium nitrate, Al in NaOH or acid, etc.) very thoroughly. Fluorocarbon plasmas can leave thin fluoropolymer films on surfaces; in LN etching with CHF3 or similar, a Teflon-like polymer can deposit on sidewalls (this is analogous to the passivation step in Bosch deep silicon etching). While a controlled polymer deposition can actually help achieve vertical sidewalls (acting as a passivation), any excess film must be removed to avoid optical loss. An O2 plasma descum after etching is thus a common step to ensure no organic residue remains. Another subtle residue can be Li2O out-diffusion: LN, when heated in vacuum or reduced conditions, can lose lithium oxide from its surface, leaving a Li-deficient, Nb-rich surface (sometimes called “black LiNbO3”). Some plasma conditions (especially reducing chemistries) could potentially cause this effect, which would change the surface stoichiometry and optical properties. Typically, however, this is mitigated by doing plasma etch in inert or slightly oxidizing ambient and not overheating the substrate excessively. In summary, etch residues—whether organic, metallic, or inorganic—must be cleaned because they can form absorption centers or scattering sites. The cleaning must be done in a way that does not introduce new damage (e.g., avoid etchants that etch LN itself too aggressively).

Mitigation Strategies During and After Etching
Given the above damage mechanisms, a multifaceted approach is required to mitigate material damage. Strategies fall into two categories: process optimization during the etch (to minimize damage creation) and post-etch treatments (to repair or remove any residual damage). The most successful fabrication processes combine both.

Optimizing Plasma Process Parameters
Careful tuning of the plasma parameters can dramatically reduce damage. One key is to adjust the gas chemistry to minimize non-volatile products. For example, using chlorine-based chemistry instead of fluorine can avoid LiF formation (producing LiCl which is easier to remove) ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#:~:text=to fabricate LNO optical waveguide,scale)). If fluorine chemistry is necessary (for higher rate), adding a little O2 or using alternate gases like NF3 can sometimes yield cleaner outcomes; NF3 plasma was explored by Osipov et al. as an alternative, since it dissociates into F and does not contain reactive carbon that could deposit polymers ([Optical diagnostic of LiNbO3 etching in NF3/Ar ICP plasma: Part I](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924424721006117#:~:text=Optical diagnostic of LiNbO3 etching,Hu)) ([PDF] Oxygen Plasma Surface‐Activated Lithium Niobate for Controlling ...). Another parameter is the pressure: running the plasma at lower pressure (a few mTorr) means sputtered atoms have a longer mean free path and are more likely to fly off and get pumped away than redeposit. Kaufmann et al. found that for Ar ICP etching, there is a threshold pressure below which redeposition nearly vanishes ([(PDF) Redeposition-free inductively-coupled plasma etching of lithium niobate for integrated photonics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367129327_Redeposition-free_inductively-coupled_plasma_etching_of_lithium_niobate_for_integrated_photonics#:~:text=Influence of chamber pressure,…)). The trade-off is that too low pressure can reduce sidewall verticality or etch uniformity, so one must find a sweet spot. Ion energy (bias voltage) should be kept just high enough to achieve anisotropy, but as low as possible to avoid deep lattice damage. In practice, bias in the 100–300 V range has been used for LN etching; higher biases (600 V) increase etch rate but also caused significant substrate charging and even wafer bowing in experiments ([(PDF) Redeposition-free inductively-coupled plasma etching of lithium niobate for integrated photonics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367129327_Redeposition-free_inductively-coupled_plasma_etching_of_lithium_niobate_for_integrated_photonics#:~:text=Influence

Mask selection and preparation is also important: use a mask that can endure the etch without depositing impurities. Silicon-based masks (SiO2, SiN, a-Si) have been used but have near unity selectivity in fluorine plasmas ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#:~:text=Different etching instruments have a,with LNO%2C have received less)) – meaning they etch almost as fast as LN, offering little protection. Metal masks like Cr, Al, or W have better resistance ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#:~:text=Different

Finally, crystal orientation-specific tactics can be used during etch. For +Z faces, performing a proton exchange or H2 plasma pretreatment prior to etching has been demonstrated to neutralize the surface charge that otherwise impedes etching () ([High-Quality Dry Etching of LiNbO3 Assisted by Proton Substitution through H2-Plasma Surface Treatment](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/16/2836#:~:text=H_{2},quality of the etching profile)). This results in more uniform etching between +Z and –Z domains. Similarly, if one is etching X-cut or Y-cut LNOI, the H2-plasma surface modification mentioned earlier improves the adhesion of metal masks (preventing issues like mask delamination that were observed on untreated Y-cut LN) ([High-Quality Dry Etching of LiNbO3 Assisted by Proton Substitution through H2-Plasma Surface Treatment](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/16/2836#:~:text=H_

Advanced Etching and Passivation Techniques
Beyond static optimization of parameters, researchers have developed dynamic and hybrid etching techniques to mitigate damage:

Etch Stop and Clean Cycles: As demonstrated by Aryal et al., one can divide a deep etch into multiple cycles. After etching, say, 500 nm depth, pause the plasma and perform a quick in situ or ex situ clean (e.g. HF dip to dissolve LiF, or O2 ash to remove polymers). Then resume etching another 500 nm, and repeat. This approach was key to their achievement of smooth, vertical sidewalls at 3.4 µm depth ([High-Quality Dry Etching of LiNbO3 Assisted by Proton Substitution through H2-Plasma Surface Treatment](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/16/2836#:~:text=processing of LN films,verticality on several crystallographic facets)). By periodically removing accumulated byproducts and cooling the substrate, each etch segment proceeds under optimal conditions (no overheating or redeposit buildup) ([High-Quality Dry Etching of LiNbO3 Assisted by Proton Substitution through H2-Plasma Surface Treatment](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/16/2836#:~:text=We demonstrated that Ti%2FAl%2FCr stack,verticality on several crystallographic facets)). The result was a “staircase-free” sidewall with roughness so low that it was comparable across various crystal cuts. Such hybrid dry/wet cycling effectively combines the strengths of chemical cleaning with plasma precision.
Atomic Layer Etching (ALE): ALE is an emerging technique to attain angstrom-level controlled etching through self-limited reactions. In 2024, Minu et al. reported the first ALE process for lithium niobate (). They used sequential exposure of H2 and SF6/Ar plasmas to achieve a quasi-atomic-layer removal of ~1.6 Å per cycle with ~97% reaction synergy (). This ALE process is isotropic and was applied after a rough plasma etch to smooth the sidewalls. Notably, they demonstrated a 30% reduction in sidewall roughness of Ar-milled waveguides after 50 ALE cycles (). The ALE mechanism is that H2 plasma first reduces/terminates the LN surface, and then the SF6/Ar pulse removes a very thin layer in a highly controlled way (). Because each cycle is self-limited, it etches peaks slightly more than valleys (a phenomenon known from ALE to naturally smooth surfaces ()). The authors also showed ALE could be done with SF6/O2 or Cl2/BCl3 chemistries, achieving near-100% ideality (). While ALE is slow, it stands out as a post-processing passivation etch that can remove damaged surface layers or corrugations without introducing new damage (due to the gentle, controlled nature of each cycle). This could be especially useful for smoothing PPLN structures where sidewall corrugation from domain patterning is an issue – ALE can essentially “polish” the waveguide after the main etch.
Bosch-like Alternating Passivation: Another concept is to deliberately introduce a controlled passivation layer during the etch to protect sidewalls from ion bombardment, and alternate this with etching steps (similar to the Bosch process in Si). In LN, an example is using CHF3 (which provides fluorine to etch and also deposits fluorocarbon polymer) in combination with Argon ion milling ([High-Quality Dry Etching of LiNbO3 Assisted by Proton Substitution through H2-Plasma Surface Treatment](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/16/2836#:~:text=experiment%2C we used CHF_,sputtering process during plasma etching)). In one experiment, a CHF3/Ar plasma at low pressure provided a degree of sidewall passivation that improved sidewall angle and selectivity with a Cr mask ([High-Quality Dry Etching of LiNbO3 Assisted by Proton Substitution through H2-Plasma Surface Treatment](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/16/2836#:~:text=experiment%2C
Proton-Exchange Assisted Etching: Mentioned earlier, performing a thermal proton exchange (PE) on LN before dry etching is a form of substrate treatment that enables smoother etching. Deng et al. (2012) showed that PE-treated LN could be etched >3 µm deep with SF6/Ar and achieve near-vertical sidewalls ([ Advanced Etching Techniques of LiNbO3 Nanodevices - PMC ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609314/#:~:text=etching%2Fwet etching of proton,69)). The sidewall was not atomically smooth (the paper noted some roughness), but the fact that a simple RIE achieved 90° profiles illustrates the benefit of eliminating Li from the surface (no LiF meant the etch could proceed unimpeded). A variation of this is poling-assisted etching, where one deliberately patterns ferroelectric domains to form an etch mask: e.g., periodic poling followed by HF etching can create micro-structures by exploiting domain-selective etch differences (Poling-assisted hydrofluoric acid wet etching of thin-film lithium ...). However, that is more a fabrication method than a damage mitigation strategy, and it sacrifices the nonlinear properties in those regions. Still, it underscores how material pre-treatment (PE, poling, etc.) can be leveraged to get smoother features.
In summary, advanced techniques like cyclic etch-clean, ALE smoothing, and surface pretreatment have recently pushed LN etching to new heights. Kaufmann et al. even outline three distinct methods for “redeposition-free” LN etching that avoid the need for any wet cleaning ([(PDF) Redeposition-free inductively-coupled plasma etching of lithium niobate for integrated photonics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367129327_Redeposition-free_inductively-coupled_plasma_etching_of_lithium_niobate_for_integrated_photonics#:~:text=provide the best optical quality%2C,of wet chemistry for cleaning)). These likely involve some of the ideas above (e.g., extremely low pressure + angled walls, or sacrificial layer removal, etc.). The trend in 2023–2025 is clearly towards damage-free etching – achieving sidewalls and surfaces that are nearly as smooth and low-loss as the starting material, without extensive post-processing.

Post-Etch Thermal and Chemical Treatments
No matter how optimized the etch, a prudent fabrication flow will include post-etch treatment to mitigate any residual damage. The two primary post-etch treatments are annealing and wet chemical cleaning/passivation.

Thermal Annealing: A moderate temperature anneal in oxygen can heal crystal damage and reduce optical losses. As mentioned, Shams-Ansari et al. found that annealing ion-sliced thin-film LN at 520 °C in O2 improved the intrinsic losses dramatically (from 1.5 dB/m down to 0.2 dB/m) ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#::text=match at L294 in ion,and demonstrate an annealing pro)) ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#:~:text=annealed at atmospheric pressures in,520 ○C for two hours)). This improvement was attributed to repairing lattice defects and improving crystallinity ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#:~:text=annealed

Chemical Cleaning and Surface Passivation: After etching and mask removal, the LN surface can be chemically treated to remove residues and passivate it. A dilute HF dip (e.g. 5% HF for a minute) will dissolve any remaining LiF or Nb2O5-rich residue and leave a fresh LN surface terminated likely with hydroxyl groups. This is a simple step that can cut down optical loss – even a small LiF crystal adhering to a sidewall could act as a scatterer, so HF ensures those are gone. For organic contaminants, a piranha clean (H2SO4 + H2O2) or an O2 plasma can be used. Sosunov’s work indicated that acid mixtures like HNO3/HF don’t significantly change the LN crystal phase or a proton-exchanged layer’s structure ([The Impact of Various Factors on the Surface of X-Cut Lithium Niobate and Properties of Proton-Exchange Waveguides by Aleksei V. Sosunov, Igor V. Petukhov, Vladimir Kichigin, Roman S. Ponomarev, Anatolii A.

After cleaning, applying a cladding or passivation layer often yields performance benefits. For example, depositing 1 µm of SiO2 over LN waveguides (via PECVD) not only protects the surface from the environment but also reduces scattering loss by index-matching the sidewall roughness ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#::text=22 Low material loss in,of the total number of)) ((PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides). The cladding essentially “buries” the rough interface in a medium closer to LN’s index, so the effective index perturbation from each bump is less. Moreover, cladding LN waveguides mitigates the photorefractive effect by screening the surface from optical fields that could induce space-charge fields ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#:~:text=23 ,IM%3A intensity modulator)). Low-temperature oxide deposition followed by a second anneal (to drive out deposition-induced damage) has produced some of the highest Q LN resonators to date ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#:~:text=in the same fabrication run%3A,sam)) ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#:~:text=ﬁts of the annealing step,5%2C and)). Another passivation approach is to chemically functionalize the LN surface – this is less common, but studies on silanization (coating LN with self-assembled monolayers) have suggested it can reduce photorefractive damage in high-power SHG by preventing water adsorption that contributes to photorefraction. In the context of etch damage, though, the main passivation is to encapsulate the waveguides with a stable dielectric (SiO2, SiN, or polymer) that locks in any remaining defected layer and minimizes its interaction with the optical mode.

Impact on Photonic Performance
Mitigating etch-induced damage is crucial for achieving the full performance potential of LN photonic devices:

Optical Propagation Loss: Surface roughness and lattice damage directly increase optical loss. Scattering from sidewall roughness and top/bottom surface irregularities causes light to radiate out of the waveguide. The dominant linear loss in many etched LN waveguides is indeed sidewall scattering () (). By smoothing sidewalls (through optimized etching or post-etch smoothing), these scattering losses can be minimized. Similarly, subsurface defects can absorb light (especially at telecommunications wavelengths if they introduce sub-bandgap states). A healed, clean LN surface approaches the material’s intrinsic absorption, which is extremely low (LN is transparent from 350 nm to 5 µm). Achieving losses on the order of 0.1–0.2 dB/m (as demonstrated with annealed and cladded samples ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#::text=devices%2C however%2C requires much lower,2 dB%2Fm))) means that etched waveguides can have performance comparable to indiffused or pristine waveguides, enabling long interaction lengths for nonlinear processes.
Resonator Q-Factor: High-Q microresonators are essential for efficient frequency conversion (optical parametric oscillation, SHG) and narrow-linewidth lasers. Any etch damage limits the Q by introducing extra loss channels. As noted, current state-of-the-art Q’s in etched LN rings (106 to 107) are often an order of magnitude below the theoretical material limit (). The gap has been attributed to residual surface roughness and domain-induced corrugations (). By implementing the mitigation strategies (smooth vertical sidewalls, proper cleaning, annealing), researchers have started to push Qs closer to 108 ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#::text=devices%2C however%2C requires much lower,2 dB%2Fm)). A Q 108 corresponds to extremely low round-trip loss, which is needed, for example, to see efficient second-harmonic generation in microrings or to observe quantum effects. In one case, annealing plus silica cladding improved ring resonator Q from a few million to 50 million ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#::text=ﬁts of the annealing step,5%2C and)) ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#:~:text=B
Waveguide Uniformity: For arrays of LN waveguides or interferometric devices, uniform dimensions and smooth sidewalls are important to ensure consistent mode profiles and coupling. Etch damage like sidewall scallops can lead to phase errors and mode size variation along a waveguide. In interferometers (e.g. Mach-Zehnder modulators or SHG quasi-phase-matched waveguides), such non-uniformities cause imbalance and reduced extinction or conversion. Mitigation strategies yield more uniform etching across the wafer – for instance, by eliminating redeposition, one avoids the “loading effect” where densely packed features etch differently than isolated ones ([(PDF) Redeposition-free inductively-coupled plasma etching of lithium niobate for integrated photonics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367129327_Redeposition-free_inductively-coupled_plasma_etching_of_lithium_niobate_for_integrated_photonics#:~:text=Aspect ratio dependent etching,…)). The result is that all waveguides on a chip can have nearly identical geometry and low variability in performance. This is key for scalable photonics where many channels must behave the same.
Second-Harmonic Generation (SHG) Efficiency: Nonlinear conversion efficiency in a waveguide scales with interaction length and optical intensity, but both can be compromised by etch damage. High loss limits the interaction length because the pump power decays as it propagates. Even if phase-matching is achieved (often via periodic poling or modal phase-matching), excessive scattering loss will drastically cut the SHG output. Thus, low loss (achieved by smooth, damage-free waveguides) directly translates to higher SHG efficiency. Moreover, SHG often requires high optical intensities, which in LN can trigger the photorefractive effect if defects are present. By minimizing lattice defects and properly cladding the waveguides, one raises the photorefractive damage threshold (). For example, MgO-doped LN is often used for high-power SHG because it suppresses photorefraction () – if the etch process introduces defects, it could negate the benefit of the doping. Therefore, preserving a pristine lattice is important for maintaining nonlinear performance under intense light. Another point is mode overlap: rough sidewalls or angled sidewalls can slightly alter the mode shape or effective index, potentially detuning phase matching or reducing overlap between fundamental and second-harmonic modes. Smooth vertical sidewalls help keep the intended waveguide modal properties, ensuring the designed overlap for nonlinear interaction is realized in practice. In short, an LN waveguide that is free of etch damage can achieve the high Q, low loss, and stable behavior needed for efficient SHG and other second-order processes, whereas a damaged waveguide might never reach the required conversion efficiency due to excess loss and instability.
Conclusion
Plasma etching of lithium niobate, while challenging, has evolved significantly to enable low-damage patterning for high-performance nonlinear photonics. By understanding the roles of crystal orientation, plasma chemistry, and process conditions, researchers have devised methods to avoid the pitfalls of redeposition, roughness, and lattice damage. Key practices include using appropriate crystal cuts or pretreatments (such as proton exchange or H2-plasma) to mitigate inherent material issues, optimizing ICP etch parameters (gas mix, pressure, bias, temperature) to minimize non-volatile byproducts, and employing robust mask systems. Advanced strategies like cyclic etch-clean processes and atomic layer etching have further pushed the boundaries, enabling nearly atomically smooth and vertical sidewalls. Post-etch annealing and cleaning remain indispensable steps to heal any residual damage and remove unwanted residues. The payoff for this meticulous fabrication effort is evident in the photonic device metrics: record-low waveguide losses approaching 0.1 dB/m and ultra-high Q resonators have been achieved by following these best practices ([(PDF) Reduced material loss in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362969900_Reduced_material_loss_in_thin-film_lithium_niobate_waveguides#:~:text=devices%2C however%2C requires much lower,2 dB%2Fm)) (). For second-harmonic generation and other nonlinear optical functions, these improvements translate to higher efficiencies and more stable operation. In essence, the field is converging on fabrication recipes that treat lithium niobate almost like an “optical glass” – etched gently and polished to perfection – rather than a stubborn refractory crystal. As these techniques mature (and move into commercial foundries), we can expect LN integrated photonics to reach performance levels previously seen only in bulk-optic implementations, unlocking the full potential of lithium niobate’s remarkable nonlinear and electro-optic properties in chip-scale devices.
