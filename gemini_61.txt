Interconnected Dynamics of Chub Mackerel (Scomber japonicus) Fisheries in the Pacific Rim: Environmental Drivers, Biological Responses, and Market Economics
I. Introduction

Scomber japonicus, commonly known as chub mackerel or Pacific mackerel, is a coastal pelagic fish species with a circumglobal distribution, inhabiting temperate and subtropical waters across the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans.1 Within the Pacific Rim, this species holds substantial ecological and economic significance. Ecologically, chub mackerel serves as a crucial forage fish, occupying a vital trophic position by converting energy from planktonic organisms (copepods, euphausiids) and small nekton (small fishes, squid) into biomass accessible to a wide array of higher trophic level predators, including larger fish such as tunas, marlins, and sharks, as well as marine mammals and seabirds.2 This role underscores its importance in structuring marine food webs within major Pacific ecosystems like the California Current, the Humboldt Current System, and the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zone.

Economically, S. japonicus supports one of the world's largest fisheries by volume, contributing significantly to global seafood supply and the economies of several Pacific Rim nations.1 Landings provide raw material for both direct human consumption (DHC), marketed fresh, frozen, canned, or smoked, and for the industrial reduction into fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO), which are key ingredients in aquaculture feeds and other products.4 The scale of the fishery is substantial; S. japonicus ranked as the sixth largest species group in global marine capture landings between 2010 and 2020.8

The population dynamics of chub mackerel are characterized by considerable variability, often exhibiting large interannual and decadal fluctuations commonly referred to as "boom and bust" cycles.18 These fluctuations are driven by a complex interplay between fishing pressure and environmental variability.19 As a pelagic species, chub mackerel is highly sensitive to changes in oceanographic conditions.4 Large-scale climate patterns such as the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), along with associated changes in sea surface temperature (SST), ocean currents, upwelling intensity, and primary productivity, exert significant influence on its distribution, migration, growth rates, reproductive success, and recruitment.4 In some regions, such as the Northwest Pacific, long-term ecological shifts involving alternations in dominance between sardine, anchovy, and mackerel populations have been observed, further highlighting the dynamic nature of these pelagic ecosystems.19

Given the ecological importance, economic value, and inherent variability of chub mackerel populations, understanding the linkages between the marine environment, the species' biological responses, and the resulting fishery and market dynamics is critical for effective management and ensuring long-term sustainability. This report aims to provide an expert-level analysis synthesizing data across these domains for key Pacific Rim regions, including Japan, China, South Korea, Peru, Chile, Russia, and the USA West Coast. The primary objective is to elucidate the interconnectedness of oceanographic drivers, chub mackerel biological characteristics (particularly interannual variations in weight and length), market price dynamics (trends, seasonality, volatility), and the overall economics of the fishery. By reviewing and integrating information from scientific literature, fisheries management organizations (e.g., Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], North Pacific Fisheries Commission [NPFC], South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation), market reports, and trade statistics, this report seeks to establish and describe the correlations and feedback loops operating within this complex socio-ecological system, directly addressing the multifaceted aspects outlined in the initial query.

II. Pacific Rim Chub Mackerel Fisheries Landscape

A. Major Fishing Nations and Key Aquatic Markets

The chub mackerel fishery is a significant component of the marine capture sector in several Pacific Rim nations, though its importance varies regionally. Identifying the primary producing nations and the key markets where the catch is landed, processed, and traded is fundamental to understanding the fishery's overall structure and dynamics.

Based on FAO statistics and regional reports, the major catching nations are concentrated in the Northwest Pacific (FAO Statistical Area 61) and the Southeast Pacific (FAO Statistical Area 87). In 2006, Japan (32%), China (23%), and Chile (18%) were highlighted as the main contributors to global S. japonicus landings.15 More recent data (2010-2020) confirms the species' global importance, ranking it sixth by volume.8 The Northwest Pacific consistently accounts for a substantial portion, often exceeding 30%, of the global chub mackerel catch.1 Within this region (FAO Area 61), the primary fishing nations include China, Japan, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan Province of China.1 Japan possesses the longest historical involvement in this fishery 1, while China's catches, particularly in the high seas regulated by the NPFC, have increased notably in recent years, raising management concerns.34 In the Southeast Pacific (FAO Area 87), Peru and Chile are the dominant producers.5 Here, chub mackerel is often caught in multi-species purse seine fisheries targeting small pelagics, primarily Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) and Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi).5 Landings in this region experienced a peak in 1978 but have shown considerable fluctuations since, influenced by both stock dynamics and environmental events like ENSO.5 The fishery off the USA West Coast (primarily California, FAO Area 67) is comparatively small, with chub mackerel mainly caught incidentally or recreationally rather than being the target of a major directed commercial fishery.2 Russia also has significant catches, particularly operating within its EEZ and the NPFC Convention Area in the Northwest Pacific.33

Identifying the specific aquatic markets involves tracing the flow from landing ports to consumers or export destinations. In Japan, while the famed Tsukiji market was historically central 44, landings and sampling occur across numerous ports in 17 prefectures.33 Japan is both a major consumer, with a preference for high-quality, high-fat mackerel 45, and a significant trader, importing substantial volumes while also exporting, particularly frozen products to markets like Vietnam, often for further processing such as canning.46 The price of canned mackerel in Japan is sensitive to domestic catch levels.53 China, as a leading producer and processor, has major ports like Shidao-Rongsheng associated with pelagic fisheries 54 and is a dominant global exporter of frozen mackerel.46 South Korea is another key consumer and producer nation, with Busan serving as a critical center for its mackerel fishery and related economic activity.20 In the Southeast Pacific, the fisheries in Peru and Chile are heavily industrialized, with large purse seine fleets landing catches at major ports primarily geared towards fishmeal and fish oil production, although portions are processed for DHC (frozen, canned) largely for export.15 Trade data reveals significant global reach, with nations like Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire being top importers of frozen mackerel, indicating that Pacific Rim production serves markets far beyond the region.46 Vietnam has also emerged as a key importer, particularly receiving frozen mackerel from Japan.46 The US West Coast market is primarily driven by recreational interest in California, with minimal commercial landings.2

This geographical concentration of production in the Northwest and Southeast Pacific creates distinct regional hubs. Events within these hubs, such as poor catches in Japan impacting canned prices 53 or ENSO events disrupting Peruvian fisheries 26, can have cascading effects through interconnected regional and global supply chains, influencing availability and prices in importing nations like Vietnam or even West Africa.46 However, pinpointing the specific major domestic wholesale markets that act as primary price-setting centers within each key producing nation proves challenging with the available information. While national production and trade figures are relatively accessible, data often aggregates different mackerel species or focuses on export/import values rather than providing consistent time series of wholesale prices for S. japonicus at specific major landing ports or central markets like those in Tokyo, Shanghai, Busan, Lima, or Santiago.45 This represents a data gap for fine-scale market analysis.

B. Economic Significance and Fishery Structure

The chub mackerel fishery, while varying in scale across nations, represents a considerable economic engine, particularly in the major producing regions of the Northwest and Southeast Pacific. Its contribution extends beyond direct catch value to encompass employment in harvesting, processing, and trade, as well as its role in supplying raw material for other industries, notably aquaculture feed.

The global scale of the fishery, consistently ranking among the top species landed worldwide 2, points to its substantial aggregate economic footprint. In South Korea, mackerel is a staple, constituting about 11% of the national capture fishery volume and 7% of the total ex-vessel value in 2020, estimated at approximately $138.6 million USD.43 Bioeconomic modeling studies focused on the Busan region underscore the fishery's importance at a sub-national level and explore the potential economic and welfare impacts of management changes.43 Japan's fishery, particularly the northern Pacific purse seine sector targeting sardines and mackerels, was historically extremely lucrative, reaching a peak catch value of JPY 67.3 billion in 1983.19 While fisheries now contribute less than 0.2% directly to Japan's national GDP, their secondary economic effects and cultural significance remain high, supporting local economies and traditional cuisine ('washoku').44 For Peru and Chile, the small pelagic fisheries complex, including chub mackerel, is a cornerstone of their national economies, especially through exports of fishmeal, fish oil, and other processed products.16 Peru ranks as the world's second-largest fishing nation by volume, largely due to these resources.58 In contrast, the commercial value of the Pacific mackerel fishery on the US West Coast is relatively minor ($400,000 USD in 2023), with its primary significance being ecological, serving as forage for more valuable predatory species.2 China, as the world's leading seafood producer, processor, and exporter, derives significant economic value from chub mackerel, particularly in the East China Sea, alongside its massive aquaculture sector.55

The structure of the harvesting sector is dominated by purse seine vessels, particularly large-scale industrial fleets, across most major producing nations including Japan, China, Korea, Peru, and Chile.2 Light attraction is sometimes employed, especially by Chinese fleets.33 Mid-water trawls are also utilized, notably by Russian and some Chinese vessels in the North Pacific, and occasionally result in incidental catches in fisheries like the US West Coast whiting trawl fishery.18 Smaller-scale operations, including artisanal vessels in Peru and Chile, and set nets or dip nets in Japan, also contribute to the total catch.2 Fleet dynamics show variability; while some regions have seen declines in vessel numbers (e.g., US commercial fleet 64, Chilean industrial fleet in SPRFMO area 42), others have witnessed rapid expansion, such as the increase in Chinese vessels targeting chub mackerel in the North Pacific 35, or shifts in effort, like the Japanese purse seine fleet redirecting towards mackerel after sardine collapses.19

The processing sector transforms the catch into various products. A significant portion, especially in the high-volume fisheries of Peru and Chile, is reduced into fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO) to supply the growing global aquaculture industry.15 Chub mackerel is explicitly mentioned as a component of the Chilean fishmeal input.17 Canning remains an important processing method, reflected in market reports from Japan 53 and the historical context of the Californian fishery.2 Japan's exports of frozen mackerel to Vietnam are often destined for canning facilities there.47 Freezing is a dominant method for preservation and international trade, with China being a major exporter of frozen mackerel.46 Other product forms include fresh/chilled for local or specialized markets 47, smoked products 49, and value-added items like fish paste derived from processing offcuts.65 Major processing capacity exists in China 55 and South Korea 43, linked closely to their substantial fishing sectors.

A critical aspect arising from the fishery's structure is the "dual-use dilemma," particularly prominent in Peru and Chile. The allocation of vast quantities of small pelagics, including chub mackerel, to FMFO production supports the economically significant aquaculture sector globally.15 However, this industrial use directly competes with the availability of these species for direct human consumption.16 This competition can inflate local market prices for fish intended for DHC, potentially impacting food security, especially for lower-income populations who rely on affordable pelagic fish.15 While redirecting some catch from reduction to DHC is sometimes proposed, its effectiveness in enhancing local food security may be limited if the products are primarily export-oriented or do not align with local consumer preferences.17 This presents a complex policy challenge, balancing the economic benefits derived from FMFO exports and aquaculture support against the goals of maintaining affordable local food supplies and supporting artisanal DHC fisheries.

Furthermore, the economic performance and ecological sustainability of the chub mackerel fishery are intrinsically linked to its structure and the management regimes in place. The transition from open access or simple input controls towards more sophisticated management systems like Total Allowable Catches (TACs) (implemented in Korea since 1999, Japan since 1997) 20 or rights-based approaches like Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) (evaluated for Chilean jack mackerel 67) aims to improve outcomes. However, challenges persist. TAC systems can still lead to "race-to-fish" behavior and rent dissipation if not coupled with mechanisms to control effort effectively.43 Overcapacity remains an issue in some fleets, such as the Peruvian anchoveta fishery.68 Moreover, historical instances show that even under management, overfishing can occur, as seen with the depletion of Japanese mackerel stocks due to heavy fishing of young cohorts following the sardine collapse 19, and concerns about over-exploitation in the East China Sea persist.61 Bioeconomic models consistently demonstrate the potential for substantial gains in both fishery profits and stock biomass through the adoption of economically rational management strategies that optimize harvest levels based on stock status and economic objectives.43 Therefore, the specific combination of fleet structure, processing pathways, and management approach profoundly shapes the fishery's economic viability and its long-term ecological sustainability.

III. Market Dynamics and Trade

A. Analysis of Historical Price Dynamics (Trends, Seasonality, Volatility)

Understanding the price dynamics of chub mackerel is essential for assessing the economic viability of the fishery and the market conditions faced by stakeholders. However, obtaining consistent, long-term price series specifically for S. japonicus across major Pacific Rim wholesale or retail markets proves challenging based on available data. Analysis often relies on broader seafood market trends, specific import/export unit values, anecdotal reports, or studies focusing on price volatility for small pelagics as a group.

General trends indicate rising seafood prices globally in recent years, driven by factors like inflation, tight supply for many wild species, increased demand (partly from developing economies with changing diets), and escalating operational costs including fuel, logistics (e.g., container shipping), and labor.58 The FAO Fish Price Index reached a record high in 2014 58, and recent reports from FAO GLOBEFISH highlight widespread price gains for many seafood products.70

Specific data points for chub mackerel illustrate these trends and highlight market nuances. In Japan, historical import prices averaged around $1.12 USD/kg between 1988-1992.45 More recent snapshot data from March 2024 shows export prices to Vietnam were approximately $19.9 USD/kg for fresh chilled whole S. japonicus and around $1.5 USD/kg for frozen whole S. japonicus.47 A significant price increase (11-23%) for canned mackerel was announced by a major Japanese company in April 2023, directly attributed to poor domestic catches and resulting high raw material procurement costs.53 This underscores the sensitivity of processed product prices to fluctuations in landings. Furthermore, within the Japanese market, S. japonicus commands a higher price than the visually similar blue mackerel, S. australasicus, necessitating careful species discrimination before shipment.74 In China, there is an indication that larger mackerel fetch higher prices, suggesting size variations can impact overall value.77

Seasonal patterns clearly influence seafood prices. Demand surges associated with holidays like Christmas 70, Chinese New Year 71, and Holy Week 72 tend to push prices upward. Increased tourism during summer months can also bolster demand, particularly in the hotel, restaurant, and catering (HORECA) sector.73 Conversely, prices for small pelagics in European markets often soften in the spring and early summer (e.g., March) as fishing activity normalizes after winter weather constraints, leading to increased supply.72 While not providing direct price data, a study standardizing CPUE for Korean snow crab found that incorporating socioeconomic factors like oil prices and export prices improved the model, implying these market drivers exhibit seasonal or annual fluctuations that affect fishery operations and potentially landings prices.79

Price volatility appears to be a defining characteristic of markets for small pelagic fish, including mackerel.80 This volatility stems from multiple interacting sources. Fluctuations in supply, driven by the inherent "boom and bust" population cycles of species like mackerel 18 and the impacts of environmental variability on catches, are primary drivers.53 Studies suggest that the variation in landings influences price volatility more significantly than the average level of landings.81 Demand shifts linked to seasonality 71 and broader economic conditions (e.g., inflation impacting consumer purchasing power 72) also contribute. Rising input costs for fishing operations (fuel) and post-harvest activities (energy, transport) exert upward pressure and can add to market uncertainty.70 Product quality is another factor; the rapid post-harvest deterioration of fatty fish like mackerel can lead to significant price reductions if not handled properly.85 Market structure itself may play a role, with potential for asymmetric price transmission along the value chain, where price changes at one level (e.g., retail) are not fully or immediately reflected at other levels (e.g., ex-vessel).84 Importantly, climate change has been identified as a factor potentially exacerbating price volatility for small pelagics, likely through its effects on stock abundance, distribution, and catch variability.80 The observed increase in price volatility for small pelagics in tropical and sub-polar regions, beyond what can be explained by changes in landing levels or variability alone, lends empirical support to this connection.81 This inherent market instability poses significant risks to fishers, processors, and traders, impacting income stability and investment decisions.

B. International Trade Patterns

International trade is a critical component of the chub mackerel market system, connecting production centers in the Pacific Rim with consumers both within and outside the region. Global trade in frozen mackerel products alone amounted to $2.35 billion USD in 2023.46

Identifying the major players in S. japonicus trade requires careful consideration due to data aggregation. Global statistics for frozen mackerel often include Atlantic mackerel (S. scombrus) and blue mackerel (S. australasicus) alongside chub mackerel (S. japonicus) under codes like HS 030354.49 While Norway and the UK are top global exporters of frozen mackerel 46, their contribution is primarily Atlantic mackerel. Within the Pacific Rim context, China stands out as a major exporter of frozen mackerel 46, leveraging its large production and processing capacity. Japan is also a significant trader, acting as both a major importer and an exporter.46 Peru and Chile, with their large pelagic catches, are major exporters, particularly of FMFO derived from these catches, but also export frozen and canned products for DHC.16

On the import side, Japan is a key destination market within the Pacific Rim.46 South Korea and China also represent large Asian import markets.49 A notable trade flow involves Japan exporting substantial quantities of frozen chub mackerel to Vietnam, often intended for processing, particularly canning.47 This highlights Vietnam's role as a processing hub within the regional supply chain. Globally, Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire are consistently among the largest importers of frozen mackerel, demonstrating significant demand in West Africa that draws upon global supplies, including likely contributions from Pacific Rim producers.46

Analysis of trade values reveals significant economic flows. China maintained a large trade surplus in frozen mackerel ($275 million USD) in 2023, while Vietnam recorded a substantial deficit (-$130 million USD), reflecting its role as an importer and processor.46 The value of Japanese frozen mackerel exports to Vietnam, based on sample shipments in 2023-2024, ranged roughly from $1.20 to $1.50 USD/kg.47

Interpreting international trade data specifically for Pacific Rim S. japonicus remains complex. The aggregation of different mackerel species under single Harmonized System (HS) codes (e.g., 030354 for frozen, 030244 for fresh/chilled) in databases like UN Comtrade makes it difficult to isolate S. japonicus flows precisely.86 Furthermore, the global nature of the market means that major players from outside the Pacific (like Norway) significantly influence overall trade statistics.46 Therefore, while the general patterns of export from major producers (China, Japan, Peru, Chile) and import by key consumers (Japan, Korea, Vietnam, West Africa) are evident, a precise quantification of S. japonicus trade originating solely from and destined for Pacific Rim nations requires more granular, species-specific trade data than is readily available in the aggregated sources.13

IV. Biological Variability of Chub Mackerel

The biological characteristics of chub mackerel, particularly their size, growth rate, and condition, exhibit significant variability both spatially across different populations and temporally from year to year. Understanding this variability is crucial, as it directly influences stock biomass estimates, fishery yields, and potentially market value.

A. Interannual Variations in Size (Weight/Length)

Numerous studies document substantial interannual fluctuations in the average size (length and weight) of chub mackerel across the Pacific. Research on the Pacific stock off Japan using data from 1970-1997 revealed significant year-to-year variation in fork length (FL) at age.29 More recent investigations in the Northwest Pacific, analyzing samples from Chinese high seas fisheries (2016-2021), confirm this variability, showing annual differences in mean standard length (ranging from 212 mm to 268 mm), estimated von Bertalanffy growth parameters (L‚àû, K, t0), and the exponent 'b' in the length-weight relationship (W=aLb), which varied between 2.78 and 3.53 over the period.1 Relative condition factors, which indicate the 'plumpness' or energy reserves of fish at a given length, also showed significant variation among years, seasons, and geographical regions within the NW Pacific during 2016-2020.3 A recent decrease in the mean weight-at-age for chub mackerel has been noted in Japanese assessments, potentially linked to increased competition.33

Studies from the Southeast Pacific (Peru, Ecuador) have estimated asymptotic lengths (L‚àû) around 40-45 cm and growth coefficients (K) between 0.34-0.39 year‚Åª¬π.92 These studies also detected strong seasonal oscillations in growth (parameter C = 0.48-0.60), indicating that growth slows significantly during the colder part of the year.92 Longevity estimates generally place the maximum age around 7 to 10 years, although older fish (age 6+) have become rare in recent NW Pacific catches, possibly due to fishing pressure.3 Shifts in the dominant size groups (modes) within the catch have also been observed from year to year in Peru.95 In Mexican waters (Todos Santos Bay), condition factor was found to be significantly higher in summer than in spring.96

The drivers behind these size variations are multifaceted. Density-dependence plays a significant role. Early studies in Japan found a negative correlation between the strength of a year class (number of age-0 fish) and the fork length achieved by age 0, suggesting that when cohorts are very large, individual growth is slower, likely due to competition for resources.29 This finding is strongly supported by recent research (2006-2019) showing that the abundance of both conspecifics (chub mackerel) and heterospecific competitors (specifically Japanese sardine) negatively impacts the body condition and growth rates of chub mackerel off Japan.10 Water temperature is another critical factor. The 1970-1997 Japanese study also found a negative correlation between SST during the early growth period (April-June) and fork length at age 0.29 Temperature directly influences metabolic rates and growth potential, with growth generally faster in warmer waters up to a certain optimum.4 However, the relationship is complex, as temperature also influences habitat selection; high population densities may force fish into suboptimal temperature zones, indirectly affecting growth and condition.10 The seasonal growth oscillations observed in the SE Pacific are clearly linked to annual temperature cycles.92 Food availability and quality, intrinsically linked to both density (competition) and oceanographic conditions (productivity), are ultimate determinants of growth and condition.3

The evidence points towards a complex interaction between density-dependent processes and environmental conditions in shaping the growth and condition of chub mackerel. High population abundance, whether of mackerel themselves or competing species like sardines, appears to intensify competition for limited food resources, leading to reduced individual growth rates and poorer body condition.10 Environmental factors, particularly temperature, modulate these processes by affecting metabolic demands, primary productivity, and the spatial distribution of both the mackerel and their prey.10 Therefore, predicting the size structure or condition of the stock in any given year requires consideration of both the prevailing oceanographic conditions and the density of the fish populations inhabiting those waters.

Furthermore, there is growing evidence suggesting that key biological parameters like growth rates and length-weight relationships are not static but exhibit non-stationarity, changing over time and space.3 Recent studies in the NW Pacific have reported slower growth rates compared to historical estimates and have explicitly recommended incorporating time-varying growth and mortality parameters into stock assessments to account for these changes.3 This non-stationarity could be driven by long-term environmental shifts (e.g., ocean warming), persistent changes in ecosystem structure (e.g., sustained high sardine abundance), or potentially evolutionary responses to fishing pressure. Assuming constant biological parameters based on historical data may therefore lead to inaccuracies in assessing current stock status and projecting future dynamics, particularly in the context of ongoing environmental change.

B. Growth, Condition, and Life History Traits

Chub mackerel exhibit rapid growth during their early life stages, potentially reaching 50% or more of their maximum length within the first 1.5 to 2 years.2 This initial growth phase appears particularly crucial for determining cohort success.21 The von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF), often incorporating seasonal oscillations, is commonly used to model their growth trajectory, although parameter estimates (L‚àû, K, t0) vary significantly across regions and time periods, as discussed above.1

The condition factor (typically calculated as K=W/Lb, where W is weight, L is length, and b is the exponent from the length-weight relationship, or as relative condition comparing observed weight to expected weight at length) serves as an important indicator of the fish's physiological state, energy reserves, and overall health.3 As noted, condition factors in chub mackerel fluctuate considerably based on season (often lower post-spawning or during winter), geographic location (reflecting habitat quality and food availability), and year (driven by environmental conditions and population density).3 Studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between body condition and subsequent growth rates, indicating that fish in better condition tend to grow faster.10

Reproduction in chub mackerel is characterized by heterosexual reproduction with external fertilization and no obvious external sexual differentiation.5 They are typically partial or batch spawners, releasing eggs multiple times over an extended spawning season.5 The timing of spawning varies with latitude and environmental conditions. In temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Japan, Korea), spawning primarily occurs from late winter through spring and early summer (February/March to June), while in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Peru), it occurs mainly from late winter through summer (August to March, peaking around January).4 Near the equator, spawning may occur year-round.7 Key spawning grounds have been identified in specific coastal and shelf-break regions, such as the waters around the Izu Islands and along the Pacific coast of Japan for the Pacific stock 10, the East China Sea for the Tsushima Warm Current stock 100, and coastal areas off Peru and Ecuador.37 Spawning activity is strongly linked to water temperature, typically occurring within a range of 15¬∞C to 22¬∞C, with an optimal temperature often cited around 18¬∞C.30 Sexual maturity is generally reached at 2 to 3 years of age, corresponding to fork lengths of approximately 22 to 26 cm.5

Chub mackerel undertake significant seasonal migrations, linking distinct spawning, feeding, and overwintering areas.4 In the Northwest Pacific, populations typically migrate northward into cooler, productive waters (like the Oyashio region) for feeding during the summer and autumn, returning southward to warmer waters for overwintering and spawning during winter and spring.23 These migrations often follow major ocean currents like the Kuroshio, Oyashio, and Tsushima Warm Current, which also play a role in transporting eggs and larvae.21 Similar north-south seasonal movements occur in the eastern North Pacific along the California Current.4 Vertical migrations, both seasonally and daily (diel), are also part of their behavior, allowing them to exploit different depths for feeding or refuge.5 These extensive movements mean that chub mackerel populations often cross jurisdictional boundaries, complicating management efforts.1

V. Oceanographic Drivers and Impacts in the Pacific

The Pacific Ocean is characterized by large-scale climate patterns and dynamic oceanographic features that profoundly influence marine ecosystems and the fish populations within them, including chub mackerel.

A. Major Climate Patterns and Ocean Conditions

Several key oceanographic phenomena shape the environment inhabited by chub mackerel in the Pacific Rim. The El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is perhaps the most well-known, characterized by significant fluctuations in sea surface temperatures (SST) across the equatorial Pacific.24 El Ni√±o events involve anomalously warm surface waters extending eastward, suppressing the normally strong upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters along the coasts of Peru and Chile.26 This disruption of the nutrient supply can drastically reduce primary productivity, impacting the entire food web.26 La Ni√±a events represent the opposite phase, with cooler-than-average equatorial SSTs and often enhanced upwelling. While ENSO's effects are most pronounced in the eastern equatorial Pacific, its influence extends across the basin, affecting weather patterns, ocean currents, and marine life distribution.24

The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) operates on longer timescales (decades) and is defined by patterns of SST anomalies primarily in the North Pacific.28 Its "warm" phase features warmer-than-average coastal waters along North America and cooler waters in the central North Pacific, while the "cool" phase shows the reverse pattern.107 These phases are linked to shifts in atmospheric pressure and wind patterns, which in turn modulate coastal upwelling, ocean currents, and overall ecosystem productivity, particularly in the California Current system and the Gulf of Alaska.27 The PDO has shown distinct multi-decadal phases (e.g., cool 1947-1976, warm 1977-1998), followed by more frequent shifts in recent decades, with a prevalence of negative (cool) phases since 2020.28

Beyond these large-scale oscillations, ongoing climate change is driving long-term increases in SST and the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves, such as the persistent "warm blob" observed in the Northeast Pacific starting around 2014.22 These temperature anomalies directly affect fish physiology, distribution, and habitat suitability.

Coastal upwelling systems, fueled by wind patterns interacting with coastal topography, are critical drivers of productivity in regions like the Humboldt Current System (Peru/Chile) and the California Current (USA West Coast).26 The strength, timing (e.g., the spring transition marking the onset of the main upwelling season), and persistence of upwelling vary interannually, influencing nutrient availability, phytoplankton blooms (often measured by chlorophyll-a concentrations), and the abundance of zooplankton that form the base of the food web for pelagic fish.4

Major ocean currents, including the Kuroshio and Oyashio in the Northwest Pacific, the Tsushima Warm Current flowing into the Sea of Japan, the California Current along the US West Coast, and the Humboldt Current (with its associated poleward undercurrent) along South America, govern the large-scale transport of water masses, heat, nutrients, and organisms (including fish eggs and larvae), thereby shaping regional oceanographic conditions and biological connectivity.21

B. Impacts on Chub Mackerel Biology and Distribution

These oceanographic drivers exert demonstrable influences on various aspects of chub mackerel biology, distribution, and abundance across the Pacific.

Distribution and Migration: Chub mackerel distribution is highly sensitive to thermal conditions. ENSO events frequently trigger poleward shifts in the distribution of warmer-water species along the US West Coast, including observations of mackerel further north than usual.24 During strong El Ni√±o events, unusual nearshore movements have been reported in the Southeast Pacific as fish follow shifting thermal fronts or prey aggregations.26 Ecological niche modeling confirms that distribution patterns in the Peruvian Current System differ significantly between El Ni√±o (more coastal suitability) and La Ni√±a (more oceanic suitability) conditions.31 Similarly, PDO phases are associated with shifts in the pelagic nekton community in the California Current; Pacific mackerel abundance notably increased following the shift to the warm PDO phase after 1977.25 Long-term warming trends are projected to drive persistent poleward shifts in chub mackerel distribution globally.22 Evidence for this is already emerging, with fishing grounds in the Northwest Pacific showing a northwestward shift, potentially linked to rising SSTs 1, and recent observations from Japanese surveys indicating more offshore distributions.40 Habitat suitability models consistently identify SST as a primary factor determining distribution, often alongside salinity, chlorophyll concentration (as a proxy for food availability), and oceanographic features like thermal fronts where prey may aggregate.4 Moonlight intensity has also been suggested as a factor influencing the catchability (and thus apparent distribution based on fishing data) for light-attraction fisheries.23

Abundance and Recruitment: Environmental conditions, particularly during early life stages, significantly impact chub mackerel recruitment and overall abundance. Strong ENSO events can severely disrupt pelagic ecosystems in the Southeast Pacific, leading to reduced survival of larvae and juveniles due to altered temperatures and food availability, potentially causing stock collapses as seen historically with anchoveta.26 While the direct impact on mackerel recruitment during such events needs further clarification, the potential for negative effects on early survival exists.26 In the Northwest Pacific, large fluctuations in stock abundance have been linked to environmental variability, particularly SST and chlorophyll-a levels during critical periods.21 A Temperature Suitability Index (TSI) derived from spawning probability-SST relationships showed regime shifts in the main spawning areas that corresponded temporally with major shifts in stock abundance for both the Pacific and Tsushima Warm Current stocks.30 These shifts in TSI, and their relationship with stock abundance, appear to be modulated by larger-scale atmospheric patterns like the Siberian High and the Aleutian Low, indicating complex climate-ecosystem linkages.30 Recruitment success is often tied to favorable conditions promoting high growth rates during early life; studies have linked faster early growth (influenced by warmer temperatures within the optimal range) and higher plankton biomass to stronger recruitment.4 However, the precise combination of factors leading to exceptionally strong year classes remains an active area of research.97

Growth and Condition: As established in Section IV, environmental factors, primarily temperature and food availability (influenced by productivity and density), directly affect chub mackerel growth rates and body condition. SST has been shown to correlate with length-at-age, particularly during the critical first six months.29 Temperature influences metabolic rates and the potential for growth 30, while oceanographic conditions determine the productivity of feeding grounds.3 Density-dependent competition interacts with these factors, potentially limiting growth even under favorable environmental conditions or forcing fish into suboptimal habitats.10

Spawning: The timing and location of spawning are constrained by environmental conditions, especially temperature. Chub mackerel typically spawn within a specific SST window (e.g., 15-22¬∞C).30 Long-term increases in SST have been observed to extend the duration of the spawning season in the Northwest Pacific by delaying its conclusion.99 Climate change projections suggest potential future shifts in spawning distributions, including contractions of suitable spawning habitat in areas like the Yellow Sea and northern East China Sea due to excessive warming.22

The relationship between these large-scale environmental drivers and the biological responses of chub mackerel is evidently complex and dynamic. Simple linear relationships are rare; responses often depend on the specific timing, intensity, and location of environmental anomalies, as well as the background state of the ecosystem and the fish population itself (e.g., density). For instance, the impact of warming on growth may be positive up to an optimal temperature but negative beyond that, and the realized effect will depend on food availability influenced by concurrent changes in productivity and competition.4 Furthermore, the non-stationary relationships observed between environmental indices (like TSI) and stock abundance, modulated by larger climate patterns 30, highlight the challenge in developing simple predictive models and underscore the need for adaptive management approaches that can account for shifting baselines and complex interactions. The consistent finding across multiple studies regarding the importance of environmental conditions during early life stages (eggs, larvae, juveniles) emphasizes that factors influencing survival and growth in the first few months ‚Äì such as temperature, food availability, and transport success to nursery grounds ‚Äì are critical determinants of year-class strength and subsequent fishery dynamics.4

VI. Synthesis: Interconnectedness of System Components

The preceding sections have detailed the individual components of the chub mackerel socio-ecological system in the Pacific Rim: the fishery landscape, market dynamics, biological variability, and oceanographic drivers. This section synthesizes these elements, focusing on the correlations and feedback loops that link the marine environment, mackerel biology, and fisheries economics, thereby addressing the core objective of understanding the system's interconnectedness.

A. Correlating Environment, Biology, and Markets

The evidence strongly supports a causal chain linking environmental fluctuations to biological responses in chub mackerel, which in turn impacts fishery supply and market outcomes.

Environment ‚Üí Biology ‚Üí Supply: Oceanographic conditions directly shape the resource base available to the fishery. Environmentally driven shifts in chub mackerel distribution, such as the northward movements observed during warm events like El Ni√±o or long-term warming trends 1, or shifts between coastal and offshore habitats 31, directly alter the spatial availability of the stock to fishing fleets operating out of specific ports. This can lead to changes in catch per unit effort (CPUE) and localized supply disruptions or windfalls. For example, an El Ni√±o event reportedly brought mackerel closer to the Ecuadorean coast, initially facilitating catches.26 Conversely, shifts to more offshore distributions, as recently noted in Japan 40, could reduce accessibility for coastal fleets. Fluctuations in recruitment success, strongly linked to environmental conditions during early life stages (e.g., SST, productivity affecting larval growth and survival) 4, determine the abundance of fish entering the fishery several years later. The strong year classes observed in Japan in 1992 and 1996, for instance, were preceded by specific environmental conditions and density levels 19, leading to temporary increases in stock biomass available for harvest. Furthermore, environmentally influenced variations in individual growth rates and condition 3 affect the total biomass yield for a given number of fish; slower growth, potentially driven by suboptimal temperatures or density-dependent competition exacerbated by environmental conditions, would result in lower overall supply biomass.3

Biology ‚Üí Market Price/Value: The biological characteristics of the landed catch directly influence its market value. The documented interannual variability in average fish size is likely to impact prices, given evidence suggesting larger mackerel command a premium.77 A trend towards smaller average sizes, as suggested by some recent studies and potentially driven by environmental change or fishing pressure 3, could depress the overall economic value of the fishery even if catch numbers remain stable. Fish condition, reflecting energy reserves and flesh quality, is also critical. Since condition varies with environmental factors and population density 10, periods of poor condition could lead to lower prices or render fish unsuitable for high-value markets like the Japanese sashimi trade.115 The rapid quality deterioration of mackerel post-harvest further emphasizes the importance of initial condition.85 Additionally, the species composition of the catch matters where different mackerel species co-occur; the higher market price for S. japonicus compared to S. australasicus in Japan means that shifts in their relative abundance, potentially influenced by environmental factors, can alter the aggregate value of landings.74

Environment ‚Üí Market Price (Direct & Indirect): Environmental factors influence market prices both indirectly, through the biological and supply pathways described above, and potentially directly. Extreme weather events, potentially linked to broader climate variability, can disrupt fishing operations, damage infrastructure, and impede transport logistics, leading to supply chain interruptions and price spikes.70 More fundamentally, the increased variability in landings driven by climate fluctuations 81 appears to translate into heightened price volatility.80 This creates significant uncertainty for all market participants, from fishers planning their operations to processors managing inventory and consumers facing unpredictable prices.

While the individual links in this chain (Environment‚ÜíBiology, Biology‚ÜíMarket Value, Supply‚ÜíPrice) are supported by evidence from the reviewed materials, studies explicitly quantifying the entire cascade from a specific environmental driver through biological response to a specific market price outcome for chub mackerel across the Pacific Rim are scarce. Bioeconomic models attempt to bridge this gap by simulating interactions between biological dynamics (often influenced by environmental parameters) and economic factors (costs, prices, effort decisions) to predict outcomes like fishery rent, profit, or regional welfare.43 However, these models often simplify market dynamics or focus on broader economic indicators rather than specifically tracking price transmission. Therefore, the synthesis of the interconnected system relies on logically connecting the findings from different studies and data sources that address parts of the chain.

B. Describing the Interconnected System

The chub mackerel fishery system in the Pacific Rim operates as a complex web of interactions where environmental drivers, biological processes, fishing activities, and market forces are deeply intertwined and exert reciprocal influences through various feedback loops.

Environmental variability acts as a primary external forcing mechanism. A change in a key oceanographic factor, such as the onset of an El Ni√±o event or a shift in the PDO phase, triggers a cascade of effects. For instance, anomalously warm SSTs associated with El Ni√±o can alter chub mackerel distribution, pushing populations poleward or into different depth strata.31 This directly impacts fishing fleets, potentially reducing catches in traditional grounds while increasing availability in new areas, leading to spatial shifts in fishing effort and landings. Simultaneously, these environmental changes can affect spawning success and larval survival 26, influencing the strength of future year classes and thus long-term supply potential. Changes in temperature and food availability also affect individual growth rates and condition 10, altering the size structure and quality of fish available for harvest.

These biological responses translate into changes in market supply (volume, size composition, quality). Fluctuations in supply, interacting with market demand (which itself can be influenced by seasonality, economic conditions, and consumer preferences) and operational costs (fuel, labor), drive the price dynamics discussed earlier, often resulting in significant volatility.53 Market prices, in turn, feed back into the system by influencing the profitability of fishing operations. Higher prices might incentivize increased fishing effort, while lower prices or increased costs could lead to reduced effort or fleet contraction.19

Fishing activity itself creates feedback loops. High fishing pressure can deplete stock biomass, which may paradoxically lead to improved growth and condition for the remaining individuals due to reduced density-dependent competition, provided food resources are sufficient.10 However, excessive fishing pressure, particularly on immature fish, can severely impair the stock's reproductive potential, leading to recruitment failure and long-term declines in abundance, as potentially occurred with Japanese mackerel in the 1990s.19 Market preferences can also shape fishing behavior; if markets demand larger fish, fleets might selectively target them, altering the age and size structure of the population with potential consequences for future spawning success.77

Fisheries management acts as a crucial intermediary within this system. Management measures like TACs, ITQs, size limits, gear restrictions, and spatial closures are designed to regulate fishing pressure, aiming to maintain stocks at sustainable levels and potentially stabilize catches and economic returns.18 The effectiveness of management in achieving these goals determines how well the fishery can buffer the impacts of environmental variability and resist overexploitation. Successful management can lead to stock recovery and potentially more stable, profitable fisheries, while management failures can exacerbate declines driven by environmental factors or unsustainable fishing practices.19

The interconnected nature of this system means that perturbations can propagate widely. A strong El Ni√±o in the Southeast Pacific not only impacts Peruvian and Chilean catches but can influence global FMFO prices, affecting aquaculture operations worldwide.15 A poor recruitment year in the Northwest Pacific due to unfavorable temperatures can lead to reduced catches, higher prices for canned mackerel in Japan 53, and potentially altered trade flows to importers like Vietnam.47 The sensitivity of chub mackerel biology to environmental drivers 4 makes the entire socio-ecological system particularly responsive to climate variability and long-term climate change, posing significant challenges for prediction and management. While the evidence clearly demonstrates the existence of these connections, quantifying the precise strength and speed of transmission through each link in the chain across different regions remains a significant analytical challenge, often hampered by data limitations, particularly regarding consistent market price series and the complexities of disentangling multiple interacting drivers.

VII. Conclusion and Recommendations

This report has synthesized information across oceanography, marine biology, fisheries science, and economics to illuminate the complex, interconnected dynamics governing chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) fisheries in the Pacific Rim. The analysis confirms the species' significant role both ecologically as a key forage fish and economically as the basis for major fisheries supplying global markets for direct human consumption and fishmeal/oil.

Key Findings:

Major Players: Chub mackerel fisheries are concentrated in the Northwest Pacific (China, Japan, Korea, Russia) and Southeast Pacific (Peru, Chile), with smaller fisheries elsewhere (e.g., USA West Coast). Key markets involve processing and consumption hubs within these regions, as well as significant export flows to other parts of Asia (e.g., Vietnam) and globally (e.g., West Africa).
Market Characteristics: Chub mackerel markets are characterized by significant price volatility, driven by fluctuations in supply (linked to biological cycles and environmental variability), seasonal demand patterns, input costs, and quality considerations. A major structural feature, particularly in the SE Pacific, is the dual use for DHC and industrial reduction (FMFO), creating economic trade-offs. Consistent, market-specific price data remains a limitation for detailed analysis.
Biological Variability: Chub mackerel exhibit substantial interannual variation in size-at-age, growth rates, and body condition. These variations are driven by a complex interplay between density-dependent factors (competition with conspecifics and other pelagics like sardines) and environmental conditions, especially sea surface temperature and food availability. Evidence suggests these biological parameters may be non-stationary over time.
Oceanographic Influence: Large-scale climate patterns (ENSO, PDO) and local oceanographic conditions (SST, upwelling, currents, productivity) strongly influence chub mackerel distribution, migration, recruitment success (particularly through impacts on early life stages), growth, and spawning patterns. Climate change is expected to drive ongoing shifts in these biological processes.
Interconnected System: The marine environment, chub mackerel biology, fishing activities, market dynamics, and management interventions are tightly linked through feedback loops. Environmental changes cascade through biological responses to affect fishery supply, which interacts with demand to influence prices and economic viability. Fishing pressure and market demands, in turn, impact stock status and biological characteristics.
Implications:

Fisheries Management: The high sensitivity of chub mackerel to environmental drivers and its tendency towards large population fluctuations necessitate adaptive, ecosystem-based management approaches. Management must consider transboundary stock structures, the influence of climate variability on productivity and distribution, density-dependent effects, and the economic consequences of management decisions. Incorporating non-stationarity in biological parameters and environmental baselines into stock assessments is crucial for accuracy. The dual-use dilemma requires careful consideration of allocation policies and their impacts on both industrial value chains and local food security.
Market Stability: The inherent volatility of chub mackerel supply and prices poses risks for industry stakeholders. Processors and traders face uncertainty in raw material costs and availability, while fishers experience fluctuating incomes. Climate change is likely to exacerbate this volatility, requiring greater resilience and risk management strategies throughout the supply chain.
Climate Adaptation: Fisheries dependent on chub mackerel must prepare for climate-driven changes, including potential shifts in fishing grounds, altered stock productivity, and increased frequency of extreme environmental events. Identifying potential climate refugia and developing management strategies that enhance resilience are critical for long-term sustainability. Integrating climate projections into fisheries management plans is essential.
Recommendations for Future Research:

Enhanced Biological Monitoring: Implement standardized, long-term monitoring programs across key Pacific Rim regions to collect consistent data on chub mackerel size, weight, age structure, condition factor, and reproductive parameters. This is vital for tracking biological responses to environmental change and fishing pressure.
Improved Market Data Collection: Develop systems for collecting and disseminating more comprehensive and accessible time-series data on wholesale and retail prices specifically for Scomber japonicus in major landing ports and consumption centers within the Pacific Rim. Improved species differentiation in trade statistics is also needed.
Integrated Modeling: Further develop and apply coupled bioeconomic-ecosystem models that explicitly incorporate: (a) realistic environmental drivers (including climate projections), (b) density-dependent biological processes, (c) fleet dynamics and fisher behavior, and (d) market feedback mechanisms. These models are essential for exploring future scenarios and evaluating the effectiveness of alternative management strategies under changing conditions.
Quantifying System Linkages: Conduct targeted research to quantitatively assess the strength and lag times of causal links within the system, particularly focusing on the transmission of environmental signals through biological responses (recruitment, growth, distribution) to measurable market outcomes (supply levels, price volatility).
Socio-Economic Impact Assessment: Investigate the socio-economic vulnerability and adaptive capacity of fishing communities and industries reliant on chub mackerel, focusing on the impacts of stock fluctuations and market volatility.
Stock Structure Clarification: Continue research using genetics, otolith chemistry, tagging, and modeling to better define stock boundaries and connectivity, particularly between the TWC and Pacific stocks in the NW Pacific and among potential sub-populations in the SE Pacific.
Data Needs:

A fundamental requirement for advancing understanding and management is the development of integrated, multi-disciplinary datasets. These should combine long-term records of environmental variables (SST, PDO, ENSO indices, upwelling, chlorophyll), biological data (size, age, condition, recruitment indices), detailed fisheries data (catch, effort by gear/fleet, spatial distribution of fishing), and market information (prices at different levels, trade volumes/values by species and product form). Collaborative efforts among Pacific Rim nations to standardize data collection protocols and facilitate data sharing through platforms like NPFC and SPRFMO are crucial for enabling robust, large-scale analyses of this vital, shared resource.
