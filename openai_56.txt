Solution Methods for Asymmetric First-Price Auctions
Closed-Form Equilibria in Special Cases
Analytic (closed-form) equilibrium bidding strategies are rare for asymmetric first-price auctions, but a few notable cases exist. Uniform distributions are the classic example: when each bidder’s private value is drawn from a uniform distribution (possibly with different supports), researchers have derived explicit equilibrium bid functions ([n218 227..286](https://pages.nyu.edu/debraj/Courses/GameTheory2003/Readings/KlempererSurvey.pdf#:~:text=Griesmer%2C Levitan and Shubik ,of it in The Economic)) ([Asymmetric first-price auctions with uniform distributions: Analytic solutions to the general case](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10036/4246#:~:text=auctions outside the symmetric case,of the two distributions)). Early work by Griesmer, Levitan, and Shubik (1967) solved the two-bidder first-price auction where valuations are uniform on different intervals ([n218 227..286](https://pages.nyu.edu/debraj/Courses/GameTheory2003/Readings/KlempererSurvey.pdf#:~:text=Griesmer%2C

Outside the uniform family, very few distribution pairs admit closed-form solutions. Symmetric cases (identical distributions) are a trivial subset – for instance, with i.i.d. uniform[0, 1] values the unique equilibrium is $b(v)=\frac{n-1}{n}v$ for $n$ bidders (so $b(v)=\frac{1}{2}v$ when $n=2$) () (). But in genuinely asymmetric cases (different distributions), closed-form solutions have been obtained only for specially structured distributions. Besides uniforms, researchers have solved a few parametric examples like “power” distribution families (e.g. $F_1(x)=x^a$, $F_2(x)=x^b$ on [0,1]) ((PDF) Asymmetric first-price auctions with uniform distributions ... Asymmetric first,case of F 1)). These yield tractable bidding functions (often involving polynomial or root terms) under specific parameters ((PDF) Asymmetric first-price auctions with uniform distributions ...

General Bayesian–Nash Equilibrium Framework
When bidders are asymmetric, finding the Bayesian–Nash equilibrium (BNE) bidding functions requires solving each bidder’s optimization problem given the other’s strategy. The general framework is to assume monotonic bidding strategies $b_1(v)$ and $b_2(v)$ for the two bidders and derive the best-response condition for each type. In a first-price auction, a type-$v_i$ bidder who bids $b$ wins if her bid exceeds the opponent’s bid. Given a conjectured strategy $b_j(\cdot)$ for opponent $j$, bidder i’s win probability is $\Pr(b_j(v_j) < b)$, which (by monotonicity) equals $\Pr(v_j < b_j^{-1}(b)) = F_j(b_j^{-1}(b))$. Her expected payoff if she bids $b$ is then $\Pr(v_j < b_j^{-1}(b)) \cdot (v_i - b)$. Optimizing this with respect to $b$ yields the first-order condition for equilibrium. Solving these conditions simultaneously for both $i$ and $j$ produces a system of coupled differential equations that the equilibrium bid functions must satisfy () (). Intuitively, each bidder chooses a bid such that if the opponent is bidding according to the equilibrium function, the marginal gain from increasing one’s bid equals the marginal loss (ensuring the optimal bid is indeed $b_i(v)$).

In mathematical terms, one finds that in equilibrium each bidder’s bid function $b_i(v)$ satisfies an ordinary differential equation (ODE) linked to the opponent’s distribution. For instance, with two bidders, bidder 1’s equilibrium $b_1(v)$ often emerges from an ODE of the form:

b1′(v)  =  f2(v∗)(v−b1(v))F2(v∗),b_1'(v) ;=; \frac{f_2(v^)(v - b_1(v))}{F_2(v^)},

where $F_2$ and $f_2$ are bidder 2’s value distribution and density, and $v^*$ is the opponent’s type that would bid $b_1(v)$ () (). A similar equation holds for bidder 2. These differential equations, coupled with boundary conditions, define the equilibrium. The boundary conditions reflect behavior at the endpoints of the value support. Typically, the lowest-valuation type bids the lowest allowable amount (often $b_i(v_{\min}) = v_{\min}$ if the support starts at a common $0$) and the highest type bids aggressively enough to win with certainty. If both bidders share the same upper bound $v_{\max}$, then in equilibrium usually $b_1(v_{\max}) = b_2(v_{\max}) = v_{\max}$ (a top type bids her value) ([Asymmetric first price auctions](https://kylewoodward.com/blog-data/pdfs/references/kirkegaard-journal-of-economic-theory-2009A.pdf#:~:text=from this comparison,construct examples with several crossings)) (). In contrast, if one distribution’s support extends higher than the other’s, the bidder with the higher possible value may not need to bid her full valuation at the top. (For example, in the uniform[0,1] vs [0,2] case, the “strong” bidder with support [0,2] never bids above $4/3$, which is just enough to beat the weaker rival’s maximum bid () ().) These boundary conditions are crucial for solving the ODEs and pinning down the equilibrium solution.

Solving the two equations is generally a boundary-value problem that may not have a closed-form solution. Nonetheless, the framework provides qualitative insights. It implies that an equilibrium (in differentiable, monotonic strategies) exists under fairly broad conditions – a result that was non-trivial to establish. In fact, the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in asymmetric first-price auctions was proven only in the late 1990s (by Lebrun, 1999) ([Asymmetric first price auctions](https://kylewoodward.com/blog-data/pdfs/references/kirkegaard-journal-of-economic-theory-2009A.pdf#:~:text=1,which explicit derivations of bidding)). Under mild assumptions (such as continuous distributions and bidders valuing the prize), one can show a monotonically increasing equilibrium bidding function for each bidder exists and is typically unique in the two-bidder case ([Asymmetric first price auctions](https://kylewoodward.com/blog-data/pdfs/references/kirkegaard-journal-of-economic-theory-2009A.pdf#:~:text=1

Theoretical Characterizations: Monotonicity and Differential Equations
Several theoretical properties aid in solving and understanding these auction models. One key characterization is that equilibrium bidding strategies are monotonic in a bidder’s own value (i.e. higher private values lead to higher bids). This monotonicity is needed to make the bidding functions invertible, which is used in the derivation of the first-order conditions. Moreover, if one bidder’s distribution first-order stochastically dominates the other’s (meaning one bidder is “stronger” in the sense of typically having higher values), then the equilibrium bid functions are not only increasing in one’s own type, but they also maintain a strict order: the weaker bidder will bid more aggressively (as a fraction of her value) than the stronger bidder at each common value () (). In other words, to overcome her disadvantage, the bidder with the worse distribution “shades” her bid less (bids closer to her true value) compared to the stronger opponent. This phenomenon is evident in the uniform example above: bidder 1 (weak) bids higher than bidder 2 (strong) for any given $v$ up to the weak bidder’s max (). It is generally true under first-order dominance assumptions that the bid functions do not cross ([Asymmetric first price auctions](https://kylewoodward.com/blog-data/pdfs/references/kirkegaard-journal-of-economic-theory-2009A.pdf#:~:text=from this comparison,construct examples with several crossings)). If dominance is reversed or only partial (e.g. one distribution has higher variance but not strictly larger values), more complex patterns including crossing bid functions can occur ([Asymmetric first price auctions](https://kylewoodward.com/blog-data/pdfs/references/kirkegaard-journal-of-economic-theory-2009A.pdf#:~:text=or stronger imply that the,but not first order)). (In extreme cases with certain distributions, multiple equilibria or non-monotonic bidding can arise, though under standard regular distributions the equilibrium is essentially unique and ordered by dominance.)

Another fundamental characterization is via the hazard rate or virtual value approach. The first-order condition for equilibrium can be rewritten in a form that equates each bidder’s foregone surplus (from shading the bid below value) to a term involving the opponent’s distribution. In symmetric auctions, this yields the well-known result that bidders bid to equalize the marginal gain: $v - b(v) = \frac{1-F(v)}{f(v)}$ (the inverse hazard rate) in equilibrium. In asymmetric auctions, each bidder’s bid function often satisfies a modified equation: for example, bidder 1’s equilibrium strategy might satisfy $v - b_1(v) = \frac{F_2(v^)}{f_2(v^)},b_1'(v)$ (as obtained from the differential equation above). These equations are difficult to solve in closed form except for particular $F_i$, but they highlight that hazard rate properties of the distributions play a role. For instance, if both bidders’ distributions are in the same “family” (like uniform or linear demand), one might solve the ODE explicitly. If not, one can still prove properties like uniqueness of the solution, or comparative statics: e.g. bidding functions shift with distribution changes (if one bidder’s distribution becomes stochastically stronger, her bid function shifts downward and her rival’s shifts upward in response, reflecting less aggressive and more aggressive bidding respectively ([Asymmetric first price auctions](https://kylewoodward.com/blog-data/pdfs/references/kirkegaard-journal-of-economic-theory-2009A.pdf#:~:text=from this comparison,construct examples with several crossings)) ()). These theoretical characterizations (monotonicity, no-crossing under FOSD, differential equations from first-order conditions) are used to guide both analytical and numerical solution methods in asymmetric auctions.

Numerical and Algorithmic Solution Methods
Because general asymmetric first-price auctions rarely yield neat formulas, researchers have developed algorithmic and numerical methods to compute equilibrium bidding strategies. The common approach is to directly solve the system of ODEs or functional equations that characterize the equilibrium. One straightforward technique is to apply a boundary shooting method: start from the known boundary at the top of the distribution support and integrate the differential equations downwards. For example, if both bidders’ maximum value is $v_{\max}$, one can initiate with $b_1(v_{\max}) = b_2(v_{\max}) = v_{\max}$ and numerically integrate the ODE system (such as equation (3) in the earlier notation) from $v_{\max}$ down to the lower bound () (). Marshall et al. (1994) pioneered this approach, proposing a numerical algorithm to compute equilibrium bid functions for asymmetric auctions (). Their method and extensions (e.g. Marshall & Schulenberg 1998) essentially solve the first-order conditions by stepping through the value range, adjusting the solution to meet the boundary condition at the lower end. A complication is that the ODEs tend to be ill-behaved at the lower boundary (especially if the lower bound is 0, the equations can become singular) () (). To handle this, algorithms often apply a change of variables or series expansion near the lower bound, or start integration from a small $\epsilon$ above the minimum.

Modern implementations build on these ideas with improved stability. For instance, one robust numerical algorithm introduces local Taylor-series expansions for the bid-function inverses to handle boundary behavior () (). By analytically expanding the solution in a power series at one end, the method avoids numerical instabilities and then connects to a standard integration scheme. This approach, described by Gan, Guan, and Virág (2020), allows highly accurate computation of equilibrium bids for a wide variety of distribution pairs () (). It can accommodate arbitrary distributions (including empirical or tabulated ones) by locally approximating the solution, essentially automating the process of “solving” the differential equations piecewise.

Another class of methods involves iterative best-response algorithms. Here, one might start with a guess for each bidder’s bid function and then iteratively update each bidder’s strategy to be the best response to the other’s current strategy. In the limit, this process converges to the equilibrium. While conceptually simple, continuous value spaces make this approach tricky; in practice researchers often discretize the value distribution into a grid (a finite type model) to compute such an equilibrium approximation. For example, one can discretize valuations and then find the Nash equilibrium of the resulting finite game (which is a system of nonlinear equations) using computational tools. This gives a piecewise approximation to the continuous equilibrium. Such methods can handle quite general asymmetries, though they may be computationally heavy and are subject to approximation error if the grid is coarse.

Specialized software has also been developed. BIDCOMP, an algorithm by Li and Riley, was an early tool that numerically computes asymmetric first-price equilibria for restricted families (it handled truncated normal and “power” distributions) (). It used a mixture of analytical integration (for those specific families) and numeric root-finding. Similarly, Bajari (2001) and others employed simulations to estimate bidding functions by iterating best responses (Asymmetric first price auctions). Overall, the algorithmic approaches trade generality for tractability: some programs are limited to particular distribution forms (), while more general ones solve the ODEs at the cost of intensive computation.

In summary, when closed-form analysis fails, economists rely on computational solutions to characterize equilibrium bids. These include: direct integration of the first-order ODEs (with enhancements like series-expansion corrections at boundaries) () (), iterative methods on discretized type spaces, and other numerical root-finding techniques. The validity of these methods rests on the theoretical properties discussed earlier – monotonicity and continuity ensure the algorithms converge to the correct equilibrium. As a check, numerical solutions are often validated against known special-case solutions (for instance, confirming that the code reproduces the known closed-form solution in the uniform case). Today’s algorithms are quite powerful, able to handle complex asymmetries that elude analytic pen-and-paper solutions () ().

Comparison of Methods and Applicability
Each solution method comes with its assumptions and limitations, and their applicability depends on the distribution type:

Closed-form solutions (when available) are elegant and offer direct insight, but they exist only for special cases (uniforms, certain polynomial distributions, etc.). They typically require nice analytic properties (e.g. linear CDFs) that simplify the ODEs. For uniform distributions, we saw that explicit strategies can be derived ([Asymmetric first-price auctions with uniform distributions: Analytic solutions to the general case](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10036/4246#:~:text=auctions outside the symmetric case,of the two distributions)); likewise, a few other parametric families yield to algebraic solution. However, these closed-form solutions do not generalize easily – if the value distributions are even slightly more complex (say beta or exponential distributions with different parameters), no simple formula is known. Thus, closed-form methods are highly limited in scope.
Analytical frameworks using differential equations are completely general in principle – they can be written down for any pair of distributions – but solving the equations requires either special tricks or numerical assistance. The strength of the theoretical framework is that it guarantees the equilibrium (under mild conditions) and characterizes it implicitly (). It also lets us prove general properties (monotonicity of bids, comparative statics when distributions change, etc.). Yet, solving the equations analytically is usually infeasible for arbitrary $F_1, F_2$. Thus, the differential-equation approach is often coupled with numerical methods. Its assumption is that bidders play differentiable, monotonic strategies (which is part of the equilibrium concept for regular cases). If a scenario violated those assumptions (e.g. if equilibrium were in step functions or mixed strategies), the standard ODE approach would need modification – but for private-value auctions with continuous types, monotonic pure strategies are indeed the norm ([Asymmetric first price auctions](https://kylewoodward.com/blog-data/pdfs/references/kirkegaard-journal-of-economic-theory-2009A.pdf#:~:text=1,which explicit derivations of bidding)).
Numerical methods are the most flexible and can handle essentially any distribution shapes (bounded or unbounded support, continuous or even empirical distributions). They do not require closed-form tractability; instead, they require computing power and care with convergence. The main limitation is that they may be computationally intensive and sometimes tricky to implement correctly (ensuring the algorithm converges to the true equilibrium solution). For instance, if the hazard rates are extreme or the support is unbounded (like exponential tails), integration algorithms might need large domains or transformations to cover the range. Numerical solvers also must contend with precision issues near boundaries (). Despite these challenges, modern algorithms have made equilibrium computation quite robust (). The assumptions for numerical methods are basically those needed for an equilibrium to exist (continuity, monotonicity) and for the algorithm’s numeric techniques to apply (e.g. differentiability for ODE solvers, or finite supports if discretizing – though even infinite support can be truncated at some high quantile for approximation).
In practice, researchers choose a solution method based on the distribution family and the insight desired. If the model permits a closed-form solution (as with uniform distributions), that is often preferred for its simplicity and transparency. One can directly compare how each bidder’s bid relates to her value and to the opponent’s distribution parameters. When no closed form is available, one resorts to solving the Bayesian–Nash equilibrium via general methods: writing the equilibrium conditions and solving them numerically. The numerical solution then allows for quantitative comparisons (e.g. calculating equilibrium bids, win probabilities, or seller revenues for given asymmetric scenarios). These methods have revealed, for example, how asymmetry causes inefficiency – the weaker bidder sometimes wins even when she has a lower value () () – and how the revenue or outcome differs from the symmetric benchmark.

In summary, solving first-price auctions with ex-ante asymmetric bidders is challenging, but a combination of approaches exists. Closed-form solutions exist only in a few symmetric or nicely-parameterized cases, such as uniform distributions ([Asymmetric first-price auctions with uniform distributions: Analytic solutions to the general case](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10036/4246#:~:text=auctions outside the symmetric case,of the two distributions)). General analytical methods provide the equilibrium conditions as a system of differential equations () and reveal qualitative properties (monotonic bidding, comparative statics) under broad assumptions. When it comes to actually obtaining the bid functions for arbitrary distributions, one must rely on numerical algorithms – integrating the ODEs or iterating best responses – which can handle the complexity at the cost of computational effort () (). Each method has its niche: analytic solutions give insight but need restrictive assumptions, while numerical solutions are universally applicable but require careful implementation. Together, these tools allow economists to tackle asymmetric first-price auction models and understand how each bidder’s strategy adapts to their relative strength or weakness in the value distribution.
