Introduction
Traditional sports coaching relies heavily on a coach’s expertise and the athlete’s subjective experience, which can limit the objectivity and breadth of feedback available to a learner (). In recent years, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) – originally developed for academic domains – have been extended to physical and sports training contexts ([A Systematic Review of Intelligent Tutoring Systems based on Gross Body Movement Detected using Computer Vision | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367148942\_A\_Systematic\_Review\_of\_Intelligent\_Tutoring\_Systems\_based\_on\_Gross\_Body\_Movement\_Detected\_using\_Computer\_Vision\#:\~:text=The computer vision applications in,the performance metrics used for)). These Sports ITS (sometimes termed “gross body movement ITS” for their focus on full-body motions ([A Systematic Review of Intelligent Tutoring Systems based on Gross Body Movement Detected using Computer Vision | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367148942

Early research and implementations have demonstrated the promise of AI-driven coaching across various sports and physical skills. Vision-based analysis (e.g. via RGB or depth cameras) allows tracking of body gestures, enabling coaching systems in domains like dance, martial arts, and sports ([A systematic review of intelligent tutoring systems based on Gross body… | VIJAY PRAKASH | 13 comments](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vijaymax\_a-systematic-review-of-intelligent-tutoring-activity-7022264929193738241-0X25\#:\~:text=The articles published from Jan,Kinect and camera were significantly)).

This report provides an in-depth examination of a Sports Intelligent Tutoring and Learning Guidance System that exploits multimodal data fusion. We begin by describing a generic system architecture, highlighting how data flows from sensors to analysis modules and user feedback interfaces. We then delve into data processing and fusion techniques, including preprocessing steps and AI models (such as neural networks for sensor fusion and pattern recognition). Next, we explore application scenarios and case studies – for instance, AI coaching systems in table tennis, billiards training, fitness exercise guidance, and tactical sports analysis – to illustrate how the theoretical system is applied in practice. We discuss challenges and future work, addressing issues like real-time performance, generalization across skill levels, integration with human coaching, and privacy/ethical considerations. Finally, we conclude with insights on the impact of such multimodal tutoring systems on sports education, and provide a list of references from peer-reviewed research, industry developments, and standards that inform this field. Throughout, we prioritize evidence from reputable studies and implementations to ground the discussion in current state-of-the-art knowledge.

System Architecture
(Table tennis coaching system based on a multimodal large language model with a table tennis knowledge base | PLOS One) Figure 1: Overview of a multimodal sports coaching system architecture (example adapted from an AI table tennis coaching system ([Table tennis coaching system based on a multimodal large language model with a table tennis knowledge base | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317839\#:\~:text=Then%2C this information is transformed,a range of alternative models))). Raw video streams are analyzed for player pose and ball trajectories, then combined with other sensor data and domain knowledge in a multimodal AI model. The AI system identifies errors, provides feedback (e.g. corrective cues, strategy advice), and guides long-term training plans.

A Sports Intelligent Tutoring System driven by multimodal data typically follows a layered or modular architecture to handle the flow from data acquisition to feedback delivery ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z\#:\~:text=System Architecture of the CPR,Tutor)) (Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education %3B

Data Layer: This bottom layer comprises all data sources and storage. Various sensors and recording devices collect raw data on the athlete’s performance. For example, a system may use a high-frame-rate video camera capturing the athlete’s movements, wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) on limbs or equipment, pressure sensors on mats or balls, and physiological monitors (heart rate, EMG, etc.) () ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z\#:\~:text=component responsible for the data,The collected data consist of)). Each modality provides a different perspective: video yields spatial and technique information (poses, trajectories), while wearables capture forces, angles, and dynamics that may not be evident on camera () (). The data layer is responsible for synchronizing and storing these streams. Since sensors operate at different frequencies, time synchronization and buffering are critical preprocessing steps () ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z
Application Layer: This middle layer implements the core logic of analysis and tutoring. Here, the multimodal data streams are processed by various modules: signal processing filters, feature extraction routines, machine learning models, and decision-making algorithms. The system often maintains an expert model (or reference model) of correct technique and a learner model representing the individual athlete’s current skill state. In many designs, there are two main phases in this layer: an offline training phase and an online inference/feedback phase ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z\#:\~:text=Tutor%2C we can distinguish two,form of the feedback prompts)). In the offline phase (sometimes called “movement modeling” ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z
Presentation Layer: The top layer is the user interface and feedback delivery system ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z\#:\~:text=System Architecture in Fig,the training of)). This is how the athlete (or coach) interacts with the tutoring system. The feedback can be presented through various modalities: visual cues (augmented video replays highlighting errors, on-screen instructions), audio feedback (verbal coaching tips or alerts) ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z
Within this architecture, additional elements ensure the system’s effectiveness. A knowledge base or model repository may be included (for instance, a database of expert demonstrations or a rulebase of coaching tips). Some systems incorporate a conversational agent or natural language interface for more interactive guidance – for example, allowing the athlete to ask questions or the system to explain corrections. The recent integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sports coaching systems demonstrates this: an LLM can be prompted with the recognized performance data and domain knowledge to generate human-like coaching advice ([Table tennis coaching system based on a multimodal large language model with a table tennis knowledge base | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317839\#:\~:text=This section will provide a,a range of alternative models)) ([Table tennis coaching system based on a multimodal large language model with a table tennis knowledge base | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317839

The modular architecture also supports extensibility and scalability. New sensor modalities can be added to the data layer (e.g. a microphone to analyze sounds of movement or an EEG headset to gauge concentration), and corresponding analysis modules can be integrated into the application layer. The system can be distributed: for example, heavy data processing or deep model inference might be offloaded to cloud servers, while a lightweight client on a smartphone handles data collection and user interface. Indeed, some commercial implementations involve a mobile app paired with wearable sensors, where the app sends sensor data to cloud AI services and then delivers feedback to the user – a design seen in products for running form analysis and personalized fitness coaching (as also reflected in recent patents by major tech companies aiming to use mobile devices for posture and motion monitoring ([For Sports Fans and Developers, Apple has filed a patent for ...](https://www.patentlyapple.com/2023/04/for-sports-fans-and-developers-apple-has-filed-a-patent-for-posture-and-motion-monitoring-using-mobile-devices.html\#:\~:text=,engaged in a physical activity))).

In summary, the system architecture of a sports tutoring system encompasses a sensing and data management infrastructure, an AI-driven analysis core, and a feedback delivery interface. This mirrors classic ITS designs (with components analogous to student model, expert model, and tutoring model) but augmented with the ability to handle multimodal continuous data and real-time interactive feedback. In the next section, we focus on the data fusion and AI techniques that operate within the application layer to make sense of the rich data and drive the guidance provided.

Data Processing and Multimodal Data Fusion Techniques
A cornerstone of sports tutoring systems is their ability to ingest and interpret multiple data modalities to form a coherent picture of performance. This requires robust data processing pipelines and fusion techniques that combine heterogeneous inputs (video, sensor streams, etc.) into meaningful indicators. We outline the key steps and methods involved in this process: from raw data preprocessing to feature extraction, fusion algorithms, and the AI/ML models that learn from multimodal inputs.

1. Data Preprocessing: Before any analysis can occur, raw data from various sensors must be cleaned and synchronized. Common preprocessing steps include noise filtering and signal smoothing (e.g., using low-pass filters on accelerometer data, or denoising video frames especially in low-light conditions) (). For video data, preprocessing might involve background subtraction to isolate the athlete (as seen in table tennis ball tracking, where background subtraction and Gaussian blurring improved ball detection ([Table tennis coaching system based on a multimodal large language model with a table tennis knowledge base | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317839\#:\~:text=Fig 2 illustrates the process,the visibility of the ball’s)) ([Table tennis coaching system based on a multimodal large language model with a table tennis knowledge base | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317839

Another part of preprocessing is segmentation: identifying the relevant segments of the continuous data that correspond to individual actions or repetitions. For example, in a weightlifting exercise tutor, one might segment the IMU data into individual lifts; in sports like tennis, segment the video+sensor stream into individual strokes or serves. This can be done via simple threshold-based triggers (e.g., detect when a swing starts based on arm speed) or more advanced activity detection models. The CPR Tutor system, for instance, needed to detect when each chest compression occurred from continuous data ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z\#:\~:text=match at L537 Real,3) feedback)), so that it could classify each compression’s quality. Accurate segmentation ensures that analysis focuses on comparable units of action.

2. Feature Extraction: Once data is cleaned and segmented, the system extracts features from each modality that capture salient aspects of performance. Feature engineering can be manually designed or automatically learned. Examples of handcrafted features include: joint angles, angular velocities, and symmetry measures from pose data; pressure distribution metrics from a balance sensor; or audio frequency patterns if listening to sounds (like a bat hitting a ball). In many modern systems, however, feature extraction is accomplished by applying deep learning models that learn an internal representation. For example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) can process video frames to extract high-level features of an athlete’s pose or movement pattern (). Similarly, a CNN or LSTM applied to sensor time-series might encode patterns of motion. In the multimodal billiards training system, the developers first extract action features from video using a CNN (capturing elements like stance stability or stroke continuity) and encode the sensor readings (force, angles) in a compatible form (). The combination of these features forms a rich vector describing the athlete’s performance at a given time or over an action sequence.

It is often useful to reduce data dimensionality while preserving important information – techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or autoencoders might be applied to compress sensor data. Some systems employ domain transformations: e.g., computing frequency-domain features for periodic motions (fast Fourier transforms to detect cadence or rhythm of movement) or using skeleton pose estimations from video (like the Kinect skeletal joints) instead of raw pixels, to directly work with joint coordinates ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z\#:\~:text=component responsible for the data,The collected data consist of)) ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z

3. Multimodal Fusion Approaches: Integrating information from multiple modalities can be handled at different stages – broadly categorized as early fusion, late fusion, or hybrid fusion. In early fusion, data from different sources are combined at the feature level, yielding one merged feature vector that is fed into a single model. This approach is exemplified by the billiards system’s use of a unified transformer model: the video-extracted features and sensor features are concatenated (or otherwise embedded jointly) and then processed together through the network () (). The advantage is that the model can learn internal correlations between modalities from the start (e.g. how a certain wrist movement on the sensor correlates with a posture change in the video). Transformers are particularly well-suited here because their self-attention mechanism can dynamically weight and relate features across modalities () (). In fact, the self-attention in a multimodal transformer allows the model to discover, for instance, that “an anomalous force sensor reading at time t corresponds to a visible form break in the video at the same t” and attend to both for making a judgment () (). Studies have found transformers effective in capturing complex dependencies in time-series multimodal sports data, outperforming traditional CNN or RNN baselines in accuracy ().

In late fusion, each modality is processed largely independently (for example, one neural network processes video to produce a classification of the technique, another processes sensor data to produce its classification), and the results are combined at the decision level. This could be as simple as averaging confidence scores or using a weighted voting scheme, or as complex as another model that takes the individual decisions as input. Late fusion is useful when modalities are asynchronous or when one wants the option to operate with only a subset of modalities (robustness). However, it may miss nuanced interactions between modalities. An example might be a coaching system that separately evaluates form via camera and effort via wearable, giving separate scores that are then interpreted together by the coaching logic (e.g., “good form but insufficient force”).

Hybrid fusion schemes combine elements of both: some features are fused early, while others might be fused late. For instance, one might early-fuse multiple video streams (if using multiple cameras) into one vision analysis, and separately analyze wearable data, then late-fuse the vision-based and wearable-based assessments. The optimal fusion strategy often depends on practical considerations like sensor reliability and available training data. If a particular sensor signal is noisy or sometimes missing, it might be safer to handle it in a late-fusion manner so that the model can fall back on other inputs.

4. AI and Machine Learning Models: With features prepared and fusion architecture chosen, the system employs AI models to interpret the data. A wide array of models have been used in sports ITS research, ranging from simple rule-based expert systems to advanced deep learning networks. On the simpler end, rule-based systems encode coaching expertise as if-then rules – for example, “if knee angle < X at lowest squat position, then form = ‘too shallow’.” Such systems were used in early Kinect-based training games and some rehabilitation coaches, offering transparency and easy adjustability. For instance, a rule-based expert system using Kinect was designed to monitor weightlifting exercises (like shoulder press) by defining acceptable ranges for joint angles and repetitions, providing real-time textual feedback when the athlete deviated ([Design and Validation of Rule-Based Expert System by Using Kinect ...](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/2/611\#:\~:text=Design and Validation of Rule,DSP) movements were)) ([Design and Validation of Rule-Based Expert System by Using Kinect V2 for Real-Time Athlete Support](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/2/611

Most modern systems leverage machine learning to adapt and improve from data. Supervised learning is common: models are trained on example data labeled by experts (e.g., correct vs. incorrect technique, or scores for performance). Vision-based models often use techniques from pose estimation and action recognition. For example, a neural network can be trained to classify a tennis forehand swing as “correct” or “various types of mistakes” based on thousands of annotated videos. Deep learning is powerful here – CNNs for spatial analysis of video, RNNs or LSTMs for temporal sequencing of motions, or hybrids of both (e.g., CNN-LSTM pipeline) for spatio-temporal patterns. The CPR Tutor’s mistake detection model was a stacked LSTM network that learned to classify the quality of each chest compression from the time-series of joint positions and EMG signals ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z\#:\~:text=match at L508 Implementation was,followed by two dense layers)) ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z

In recent cutting-edge examples, transformers and multimodal deep learning models are employed for their ability to handle multiple inputs and long sequences. The billiards training system used a transformer to fuse video and sensor data, generating a comprehensive “technical performance vector” that feeds into their evaluation logic () (). Similarly, some research prototypes use graph neural networks to model relationships (like segments of the body as a graph of joints) or fusion autoencoders that learn a joint latent space of vision and sensor data. The choice of model also depends on the task: classification (e.g., type of error), regression (e.g., scoring the skill on a numeric scale), or even generation (e.g., generating a recommended exercise program, which might use an LLM as in the table tennis example).

An emerging class of models in this domain are multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge-based AI. The table tennis coaching system combined visual recognition (for trajectories and pose) with a domain-specific knowledge base fed into GPT-4 to analyze and explain the player’s mistakes ([Table tennis coaching system based on a multimodal large language model with a table tennis knowledge base | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317839\#:\~:text=Then%2C this information is transformed,a range of alternative models)) ([Table tennis coaching system based on a multimodal large language model with a table tennis knowledge base | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317839

5. Integration and Continuous Learning: Multimodal systems can also employ feedback loops. Reinforcement learning might be used in some research to adapt the tutoring strategy: for instance, to choose the next exercise or difficulty level based on how the athlete responded to previous feedback. While not yet common, one can envision an RL agent that treats the coaching process as a sequential decision problem (state = athlete’s performance metrics, action = coaching intervention, reward = improvement). Another aspect is model adaptation over time: as the system gathers more data from a particular athlete, it could personalize its models (for example, calibrate what “good form” means for that individual’s body proportions, or adjust thresholds if the person has an injury). Techniques like online learning or periodic model retraining with the user’s own data come into play here, albeit with caution to avoid deviating from expert standards.

To ensure technical robustness, standards and best practices from the field of data fusion are applied. For instance, sensor fusion often follows frameworks such as the Kalman filter or Bayesian fusion for combining quantitative sensor measurements in real-time – e.g., fusing a gyroscope and video-based orientation estimate to get a more accurate angle than either alone. In more discrete terms, confusion matrices and accuracy metrics are used to evaluate how well the multimodal model performs, with research showing that combining modalities usually improves accuracy of skill assessment ([A systematic review of intelligent tutoring systems based on Gross body… | VIJAY PRAKASH | 13 comments](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vijaymax\_a-systematic-review-of-intelligent-tutoring-activity-7022264929193738241-0X25\#:\~:text=The articles published from Jan,Kinect and camera were significantly)). Indeed, a classifier using fused multimodal inputs outperformed those using any single modality in detecting student distress in an educational game context ([Multimodal Data Fusion to Track Students' Distress during ...](https://learning-analytics.info/index.php/JLA/article/view/7631\#:\~:text=analytics,distress states during educational gameplay)), a result that translates to higher reliability in detecting sports performance issues as well.

In summary, multimodal data processing in sports ITS involves cleaning and aligning data, extracting meaningful features, and feeding them into sophisticated AI models that fuse modalities. By leveraging architectures like deep neural networks (especially CNNs, RNNs, and transformers) that can learn cross-modal representations, these systems can recognize complex performance patterns and provide feedback that is far more insightful than what single-sensor systems or human observation alone could achieve. The next section will illustrate practical applications of these techniques in real-world sports education and training scenarios, demonstrating the outcomes of such systems.

Application Scenarios in Sports Education and Training
Intelligent coaching systems powered by multimodal data fusion have been prototyped and applied in a variety of sports and physical training scenarios. In this section, we discuss several representative use cases, highlighting the system’s architecture, the type of data used, and the kind of guidance provided to learners. These examples demonstrate the practical value of combining multiple data streams for training feedback and illustrate both current capabilities and future potential in sports education.

1. Racket Sports Coaching (Table Tennis and Tennis): Racket sports involve fast movements, precise techniques, and strategic play, making them fertile ground for AI tutoring. A recent example is an AI table tennis coaching system that integrates video analysis with a knowledge-driven AI tutor ([Table tennis coaching system based on a multimodal large language model with a table tennis knowledge base | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317839\#:\~:text=using visual recognition technology%2C motion,is expected to play a)). In this system, a single camera captures the player’s strokes and the ball trajectory. Computer vision algorithms track the ball and recognize its trajectory in real time ([Table tennis coaching system based on a multimodal large language model with a table tennis knowledge base | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317839

2. Personalized Training in Ball Sports (Billiards/Pool example): Billiards may appear to rely more on strategy and precision than physical exertion, but executing a pool shot involves a coordinated action that benefits from multimodal guidance. A billiards training intelligent system was proposed that fuses video, cue-mounted sensors, and table-mounted sensors to evaluate a player’s skills and even generate training plans () (). In this setup, a high-speed camera records the player’s stance and cue movement. Sensors on the cue and the player’s wrist measure the force of the stroke, angle of cue, and stroke consistency () (). Meanwhile, the smart billiard table (outfitted with embedded sensors or a camera) tracks the resulting ball trajectory – its speed, spin, and collision points on the table (). By combining these data, the system achieves a comprehensive view: how the player’s action translated into the ball’s behavior. A deep learning model (utilizing a transformer as noted earlier) analyzes this fused data to assess technical performance, such as stroke accuracy, cue control, and even the player’s tactical decision-making (e.g., was the chosen shot optimal given the layout?) () (). The output is not just immediate feedback but also a personalized training plan (). For instance, if analysis shows the player struggles with maintaining a stable stance and follow-through on long shots, the system might recommend specific drills focusing on stance stability or cue straightness (). It can adjust these recommendations as the player improves (a form of adaptive curriculum): beginners might get basic cue alignment exercises, whereas advanced players get complex scenario practices (). Additionally, the system was noted to provide strategic suggestions, such as advice on predicting an opponent’s shots or choosing the best next shot in a game situation (). This crosses into cognitive tutoring – guiding the learner’s tactical thinking by analyzing game situations. In evaluations, such a system was tested with groups of players of varying skill levels over an 8-week training program, and those using the intelligent system showed measurable improvements in shooting accuracy and tactical decision-making compared to a control group with traditional coaching (as reported in the study’s experimental results) () (). This billiards example showcases how multimodal ITS can both act as a real-time coach and a planning assistant for long-term development.

3. Fitness and Physiotherapy Exercises: Not all applications are in competitive sports; many are in general fitness, physical education, and rehabilitation – domains focused on teaching proper movement form. Here, the emphasis is on preventing injury and ensuring exercises are done correctly. A notable example is using the Microsoft Kinect (depth camera) to guide gym exercises. Researchers Örücü and Selek (2020) developed a rule-based expert system for weight training that monitored exercises like lateral raises and shoulder presses using the Kinect v2 sensor ([Design and Validation of Rule-Based Expert System by Using Kinect ...](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/2/611\#:\~:text=Design and Validation of Rule,DSP) movements were)) ([Design and Validation of Rule-Based Expert System by Using Kinect V2 for Real-Time Athlete Support](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/2/611

4. Team Sports and Tactical Training: Beyond individual technique, AI tutoring systems are being explored for teaching strategic and tactical aspects of sports. In sports like soccer, basketball, or football, decision-making (when to pass, where to move) is as critical as technical skill. While this ventures beyond traditional one-on-one “tutoring,” some systems provide guidance by analyzing game situations using multimodal data. For example, one research project developed a tactical analysis system for football (soccer) matches using deep learning to analyze player movements and decisions, with the aim of providing tactical optimization suggestions to the players (). Such a system would use game video (potentially multiple cameras or panoramic video) combined with player tracking data (from GPS trackers or broadcast sports analytics) to understand formations and movement patterns. AI models can then identify tactical errors or missed opportunities – for instance, a system might detect that a team’s defensive line was too high and suggest adjustments, or for an individual player, point out open teammates they missed in a play. While this starts to resemble the tools used by professional coaches for post-game analysis, integrating it into a tutoring system means it could interactively teach less experienced players. Imagine a training simulator where a player’s choices in a scenario (e.g., a 3-on-2 offensive play) are analyzed by the AI, and the system pauses to ask the player questions or give hints about better choices (“Notice how your teammate on the left was unmarked – consider passing earlier next time”). Another example is a system that teaches playbook strategies in American football: using AR glasses, a player could run through a play and the system (tracking their position and head movement) can tell if they looked at the correct reads in the defense, effectively tutoring the cognitive skill of reading the game. These applications rely on multimodal inputs like field position data, player gaze (from headsets), and perhaps communication audio, fused to evaluate decision-making processes. While still in early stages, such systems illustrate that sports ITS can cover more than motor skills – they can also function as intelligent training partners for the mental and tactical dimensions of sports.

5. Real-Time Feedback Trainers (Case: CPR and Beyond): As a cross-domain example (not a competitive sport but a physical skill), the CPR Tutor system provides a template for real-time feedback trainers in any physical task ([Keep Me in the Loop: Real-Time Feedback with Multimodal Data | International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-021-00281-z\#:\~:text=This paper describes the CPR,Hence%2C we)). The CPR Tutor used multimodal data (depth camera + EMG) to give live corrective feedback in a life-saving skill scenario. This concept can translate to sports like rock climbing or yoga, where real-time adjustments are important. In climbing, one could imagine a system with body-worn sensors and a wall camera, alerting a climber if their center of gravity is off or if they are over-gripping holds (detected via forearm muscle activity). In yoga or gymnastics, maintaining certain postures and balance is key – a system with pressure mats and pose estimation could gently correct alignment (“shift weight to your right foot”) as the practitioner holds a pose. The immediacy of feedback in such systems leverages multimodal detection of subtle changes (like weight distribution or muscle tremors) and compares against learned ideal models. Early studies in dance training using Kinect also followed this idea – the system compares the student’s dance moves to a prerecorded expert model and highlights differences, sometimes by overlaying the expert’s avatar and using visual cues to show where the student should adjust ([A systematic review of intelligent tutoring systems based on Gross body… | VIJAY PRAKASH | 13 comments](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vijaymax\_a-systematic-review-of-intelligent-tutoring-activity-7022264929193738241-0X25\#:\~:text=The articles published from Jan,Kinect and camera were significantly)). Though real-time feedback is powerful, these systems must be carefully designed to not distract at crucial moments (hence often using simple audio tones or brief cues).

These scenarios, summarized in Table 1 below, highlight how multimodal intelligent tutoring systems are being tailored to different needs in sports and physical education. The flexibility of combining various data streams allows each system to be customized: for some, low-cost single-camera setups suffice; for others, instrumented equipment and wearables provide extra precision. All, however, share the goal of providing accessible, personalized coaching. Even in the absence of a human coach, or as a supplement to coaching, these systems guide learners through deliberate practice, thereby accelerating skill acquisition and reducing the risk of ingraining bad habits.

Table 1: Examples of multimodal intelligent tutoring systems applied to sports or physical training, illustrating the diversity of modalities and AI approaches. Each system is tailored to its domain but shares a common goal of augmenting or replacing human coaches by providing objective analysis and personalized guidance.

Beyond these, numerous commercial products and prototypes indicate the rising interest in AI-guided sports training. Major sporting goods companies and tech firms are investing in smart coaching devices – for instance, smart basketballs and soccer balls that record impact data, or apps like NTT’s “Embodied AI Coach” that claim to use pose estimation to give feedback in sports like swimming and golf ([CAM-Vtrans: real-time sports training utilizing multi-modal robot data](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11502466/\#:\~:text=athletes with highly accurate and,timely feedback)) ([Accurate and Real-Time Sports Coaching | NTT STORY](https://group.ntt/en/magazine/blog/sports\_coaching/\#:\~:text=Accurate and Real,accurate feedback to athletes%2C)). Patents have been filed for systems that monitor athletic performance via mobile devices and wearables to give technique feedback (e.g., Apple’s patent for posture and motion monitoring using an iPhone’s sensors as a training tool ([For Sports Fans and Developers, Apple has filed a patent for ...](https://www.patentlyapple.com/2023/04/for-sports-fans-and-developers-apple-has-filed-a-patent-for-posture-and-motion-monitoring-using-mobile-devices.html\#:\~:text=,engaged in a physical activity))). These developments, while not all peer-reviewed, align with the trajectory identified in academic research: leveraging multimodal data and AI to make sports training more data-driven and individualized.

It’s worth noting that in formal physical education (e.g., school PE classes or coaching certification), these intelligent systems can serve as training aids for instructors as well. For example, a PE teacher could use a multimodal system to track each student’s progress on a particular skill and identify who needs extra help and on what aspect – effectively providing analytics that guide teaching. Similarly, athletes themselves can use these tools for self-reflection and analysis, reviewing the data and feedback to become more self-aware of their technique (in line with principles of motor learning that encourage learners to internalize feedback). All these scenarios underscore a paradigm shift: with multimodal intelligent guidance, high-quality coaching is no longer confined to elite athletes with access to top coaches, but can be scaled to benefit learners at all levels.

Challenges and Future Work
While the progress in sports intelligent tutoring systems is impressive, there remain significant challenges to address and opportunities for future improvements. We discuss some of the key issues below, along with emerging directions that researchers and developers are exploring:

Data Integration and Technical Challenges: Fusing multimodal data in real-time is non-trivial. Ensuring synchronization and low-latency processing can be difficult, especially when using high-resolution video or multiple sensors streaming large amounts of data. Systems must handle occasional data loss or sensor errors gracefully – for instance, if a camera view is occluded or a sensor disconnects, the tutor should not crash or give false feedback. Developing robust sensor fusion algorithms is an ongoing challenge; techniques from robotics and autonomous vehicles (which face similar multimodal fusion issues) are being adapted to sports coaching. There is also the issue of standardization: different sports and systems might use different data formats and protocols. Efforts like the IEEE standards for wearable sensor data or training data exchange formats could help interoperability in the future. Additionally, many current systems are prototypes tested in controlled environments; making them work “in the wild” (e.g., on a noisy soccer field or in a crowded gym) requires addressing variability in background, lighting, and unforeseen events.
Accuracy and Generalization of AI Models: AI models need to be very accurate in assessing performance; a wrong feedback can confuse learners or even instill bad habits. Training these models often requires large labeled datasets of sports performances, which can be hard to obtain (especially negative examples of incorrect technique, since recording lots of mistakes by athletes is not always feasible). Some systems resort to synthetic data or augmentations (for example, simulating errors in motion capture data) to train models, but there is still a need for more comprehensive datasets. The systematic review of gross-body ITS found that most studies had very limited numbers of users and were often only tested with beginners ([A systematic review of intelligent tutoring systems based on Gross body… | VIJAY PRAKASH | 13 comments](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vijaymax\_a-systematic-review-of-intelligent-tutoring-activity-7022264929193738241-0X25\#:\~:text=text%2C audio%2C or visual format,of ethics and its use)). This raises concerns about generalization: a model trained on one group (say novice college students) might not work well for others (like children, or advanced athletes who have different movement patterns). Future work should focus on expanding user studies and data collection to include diverse participants and skill levels ([A systematic review of intelligent tutoring systems based on Gross body… | VIJAY PRAKASH | 13 comments](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vijaymax
Real-time Feedback and Human Factors: Determining the optimal feedback strategy is as much a human factors question as a technical one. If feedback is too frequent or interruptive, it can hinder the natural flow of practice and annoy the user. If too sparse or vague, it might not be helpful. Striking the right balance (feedback frequency, modality, and content) is an open question and likely depends on the context and user preference. Researchers are looking at adaptive feedback systems that can adjust their frequency and level of detail based on how the learner is responding – for example, slowing down feedback if the learner seems overwhelmed, or providing more detailed explanations if the learner asks for them. Another challenge is multi-user or team scenarios: most current systems coach one person at a time, but in sports like doubles tennis or synchronized swimming, you might want to coach a pair or team on their coordinated performance. This requires the system to track and analyze multiple people and possibly give joint feedback (e.g. “Player A and B, your timing is off when executing a play – try to synchronize better”). Ensuring the feedback remains understandable when addressing multiple users is a new area to explore.
User Acceptance and Integration with Coaching: The role of intelligent tutoring systems relative to human coaches is a subject of discussion. Rather than replacing coaches, these systems are generally seen as assistive tools – but they need acceptance from both athletes and coaches to be used effectively. Coaches may need training to interpret system outputs or to configure the system (for example, setting appropriate difficulty or focus areas). There can be resistance if the system’s advice conflicts with a coach’s philosophy. Building trust in the AI recommendations is key: this can be aided by making the AI’s decisions more transparent (explainable AI techniques, such as showing why the system thinks a squat was too shallow by visualizing angle measurements). In the future, we might see hybrid coaching, where the AI handles routine monitoring and data crunching, freeing human coaches to focus on higher-level strategy and psychological mentoring. Some sports academies are already incorporating motion tracking systems for objective data while coaches interpret the results – a trend likely to grow.
Privacy and Ethical Considerations: Multimodal tutoring systems often record detailed personal data: video of individuals, biometric signals, performance metrics. This raises privacy concerns, especially for minors in educational settings or for sensitive contexts like injury rehab. Ensuring data is stored securely and anonymized when used in research is important. Moreover, if such systems become widespread, questions arise about data ownership – does the athlete own their motion data or does the company providing the system own it? Ethical use of the data (for example, not using an athlete’s performance data to make unauthorized evaluations, or to respect consent if sharing data with third parties) must be considered. The GBM-ITS review highlighted privacy and ethics as an area that needs more attention as the technology progresses ([A systematic review of intelligent tutoring systems based on Gross body… | VIJAY PRAKASH | 13 comments](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vijaymax\_a-systematic-review-of-intelligent-tutoring-activity-7022264929193738241-0X25\#:\~:text=also used for data capturing,of ethics and its use)). Another ethical aspect is psychological impact: how the feedback is phrased and delivered can affect a learner’s motivation and confidence. Care must be taken to keep the guidance positive or at least constructive. Over-reliance on automated feedback could also reduce a learner’s self-assessment skills, so future designs might incorporate features to sometimes prompt the athlete to self-reflect (“How do you think that attempt went?”) before giving the answer, thus keeping the human in the loop of their own learning process.
Advances in Sensing and Immersive Tech: On the horizon, new sensors and immersive technologies promise to make multimodal coaching systems more effective and engaging. Augmented Reality (AR) glasses or headsets can overlay instructions or corrective cues onto the athlete’s field of view (for instance, showing the ideal trajectory of a swing as a holographic guide, or highlighting the spot on the goal to aim for in soccer). This can provide intuitively aligned feedback right where the athlete needs to focus. Virtual reality (VR) can create safe virtual sports environments for practice, where the ITS can control scenarios precisely and even simulate opponents. For example, a VR boxing trainer could simulate different sparring partners and use haptic feedback gloves to let the user know if their guard dropped (detected via motion sensors) by vibrating the gloves when an “virtual punch” gets through. The immersive aspect could also improve engagement and motivation – turning training into a game-like experience with real-time coaching. However, adding AR/VR means the system must operate under strict real-time constraints with low latency to avoid motion sickness or confusion. Researchers Cardenas-Hernandez et al. (2024) suggest that immersive technologies combined with multimodal data can importantly target aspects like mental focus and body awareness that traditional methods miss ([(PDF) Beyond hard workout: A multimodal framework for personalised running training with immersive technologies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378502409\_Beyond\_hard\_workout\_A\_multimodal\_framework\_for\_personalised\_running\_training\_with\_immersive\_technologies\#:\~:text=tackle its challenges and limitations,as a foundation for future)). Measuring an athlete’s mental state (via EEG headbands or heart rate variability for stress) and providing biofeedback could be part of future holistic coaching systems – for instance, teaching a basketball player not just the mechanics of a free throw but also breathing techniques to stay calm, monitored by a heart rate sensor.
Enhanced Feedback and Engagement: Future systems may move beyond simple textual or audio feedback to more interactive dialogue and comprehensive guidance. With the advent of conversational agents (like coaching chatbots) powered by advanced AI, an athlete might be able to ask follow-up questions: “What did I do wrong that time?” or “How can I improve my endurance?” and get informed answers, drawing from both the athlete’s data and sports science knowledge ([Language and Multimodal Models in Sports: A Survey of Datasets ...](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.12252v1\#:\~:text=Language and Multimodal Models in,and multimodal models in sports)). This transforms the system into not just a tutor but a 24/7 personal coach and mentor. There’s also potential for these systems to facilitate remote coaching: a human coach can log in to see the data and video from a trainee’s session (with the system’s analysis as a guide), then have a video call or send feedback. This hybrid model could democratize access to expert coaching, with AI as the bridge between coach and athlete when physically apart.
Validation and Standards: With many new systems being proposed, there’s a need for thorough validation – not just that the AI’s predictions are accurate, but that using the system indeed leads to better learning outcomes compared to traditional coaching. Longitudinal studies could measure how athletes progress with an intelligent tutor versus with just a coach or self-practice. Establishing technical standards for reporting results (for instance, common metrics for skill improvement, or guidelines for describing multimodal setups) would help compare systems. Additionally, as the field matures, we may see the rise of benchmark datasets and competitions (similar to how computer vision has ImageNet, etc.) specifically for multimodal sports analysis, which would drive improvements in algorithms. Shared datasets of annotated sports movements, if privacy can be managed, would allow many research groups to train and test models, accelerating progress ([A systematic review of intelligent tutoring systems based on Gross body… | VIJAY PRAKASH | 13 comments](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vijaymax\_a-systematic-review-of-intelligent-tutoring-activity-7022264929193738241-0X25\#:\~:text=also used for data capturing,of ethics and its use)) (the review by Ashwin et al. noted that dataset dissemination will be key to advancing GBM-ITS development ([A systematic review of intelligent tutoring systems based on Gross body… | VIJAY PRAKASH | 13 comments](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vijaymax
In conclusion, the challenges of building effective sports tutoring and guidance systems are as much about understanding human learning and behavior as they are about technology. Future work must take an interdisciplinary approach – involving sport scientists, coaches, psychologists, and ethicists alongside AI engineers – to ensure these systems are not only high-performing in a lab, but also safe, ethical, and truly beneficial in the real world of sports training. Despite the challenges, the trend is clearly towards more integration of AI and multimodal data in sports. As sensor technology improves, AI models become more powerful, and we learn more about optimizing feedback, the vision of an “intelligent coach” that can accompany an athlete anywhere might well become an everyday reality.

Conclusion
The convergence of advanced sensing technologies and artificial intelligence has paved the way for intelligent tutoring and guidance systems in sports that were unimaginable just a decade ago. By leveraging multimodal data fusion – integrating video, sensor signals, and contextual information – these systems achieve a rich understanding of athletic performance and offer tailored, real-time feedback to learners. In this report, we explored both the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations of such systems. We saw that a typical architecture involves multiple layers handling data capture, analysis, and feedback, underpinned by AI models that learn to assess technique and decision-making. Multimodal data fusion emerged as a critical ingredient, allowing systems to outperform single-source approaches by capturing the full spectrum of an athlete’s interaction with their sport () ([A systematic review of intelligent tutoring systems based on Gross body… | VIJAY PRAKASH | 13 comments](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vijaymax\_a-systematic-review-of-intelligent-tutoring-activity-7022264929193738241-0X25\#:\~:text=The articles published from Jan,Kinect and camera were significantly)).

Real-world applications demonstrate the versatility of this approach: from helping novices master the basics of a sport with instant corrections, to assisting experienced players in fine-tuning their skills or strategy with detailed analytics. Whether it’s an AI ping-pong coach that spots a swing flaw ([Table tennis coaching system based on a multimodal large language model with a table tennis knowledge base | PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317839\#:\~:text=using visual recognition technology%2C motion,is expected to play a)), a virtual trainer that keeps your back straight during a deadlift, or a tactical advisor that dissects your team’s gameplay, these systems represent a new kind of “assistant” in training – one that is always observant, data-informed, and personalized. Importantly, intelligent tutoring systems in sports do not aim to replace human coaches, but to supplement and enhance coaching. They provide objective measurements and endless patience for repetition, freeing coaches to focus on the art of coaching that machines cannot replicate (motivation, inspiration, and nuanced strategy). For self-learners or those without access to expert coaches, these systems can democratize skill development, bringing high-quality guidance to anyone with a smartphone or a sensor kit.

The development of sports ITS also contributes back to research in education and AI. It pushes the boundaries of multimodal machine learning, real-time algorithm design, and human-computer interaction in learning contexts. The lessons learned in ensuring effective feedback for physical tasks may translate to other domains (for example, training surgeons or manual labor skills with similar multimodal setups). Conversely, educational theories remind us that feedback must be scaffolded to the learner’s level and that motivational aspects cannot be ignored – guiding principles that have influenced the design of these sports systems from the start.

Looking ahead, the field is poised for exciting growth. We anticipate more immersive and integrated systems – perhaps an athlete in an AR arena, receiving live pointers from an AI that sees their every move, or intelligent gym equipment that adapts resistance and technique cues on the fly. We also expect more seamless blending of informative feedback with engaging experience, so training with an AI tutor feels less like being evaluated by a machine and more like playing a game or working with a friendly coach. As researchers address current challenges such as data scarcity, model generalization, and user trust, these systems will become more robust and widely applicable. Ultimately, the goal is to unlock higher levels of human performance and learning efficiency by harnessing technology. A future olympian might recall how, as a child, they perfected their skills with the help of an AI coaching system at home – a testament to how far personalized, data-driven guidance can take us.

In summary, a Sports Intelligent Tutoring and Learning Guidance System driven by multimodal data fusion embodies an interdisciplinary triumph: it melds sports science, learning science, and cutting-edge AI to create tools that empower athletes. By providing immediate, detailed, and personalized feedback, such systems can accelerate skill acquisition, reduce injuries by catching errors early, and complement the wisdom of human coaches. The continued collaboration of academia and industry in this arena, guided by rigorous research and ethical considerations, will ensure that these intelligent systems truly enhance sports education and training for all.
